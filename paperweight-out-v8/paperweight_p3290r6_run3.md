Verdict: Strong (9/14)

The paper offers substantial support for the need to standardize this integration, particularly through its discussion of migration paths, implementation experience, and interoperability with existing assertion facilities. The thinnest part of the case is the absence of any argument for why a library-only solution would be insufficient, which leaves a notable gap in the justification for standardization specifically.

- The strongest support comes from the demonstrated implementation experience in both libc++ and libstdc++, with working branches available on Compiler Explorer.
- The paper also establishes why the standard is the right venue by showing how a central, user-selectable violation handler enables consistent diagnostics across large programs and legacy facilities.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is well grounded, including comparison with P3311R0 and the tradeoffs of macro-based control.
- The most glaring omission is the failure to establish why a library will not do, leaving unanswered whether the same integration could be achieved without changes to the standard.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Pre-existing contract-checking facilities, such as `assert`, occasionally have fundamentally different semantics and provide completely different control mechanisms for their behavior.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The primary goal of the integration with `cassert` is not to change the semantics of `cassert` itself but to allow integration with the user’s violation reporting mechanisms.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Providing the beginnings of a migration path for users of legacy assertion facilities — both `assert` and homegrown solutions — is an essential part of making early use of the Contracts facility viable for many users.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Pre-existing contract-checking facilities, such as `assert`, occasionally have fundamentally different semantics and provide completely different control mechanisms for their behavior.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): In another, similar proposal, [P3311R0], the name `ASSERT_USES_CONTRACTS` was proposed.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): An alternative proposal, [P3311R0], proposed using a user-defined macro to control that choice (on the command line or in code).
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The changes to assert are similar, with the most impactful one being that both libraries needed to begin providing their own versions of `assert.h` that delegates to the underlying C library header using `#include_next`.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): By having a central and user-selectable contract-violation handler, those who assemble large programs can avoid having distinct libraries producing different bug responses that do not fit into a single and consistent diagnostic and mitigation strategy.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 36 passes): The hooks proposed in this paper allow for such legacy facilities to live side-by-side with C++ contracts, require no major changes to legacy facilities’ existing semantics, and open the door to integration with Contracts as soon as they are available.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 36 passes): Integrating these facilities with the contract-violation handler, however, can be an incredibly useful tool for enabling a gradual migration from older facilities to the newer tools provided by the language itself.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 36 passes): Providing the beginnings of a migration path for users of legacy assertion facilities — both `assert` and homegrown solutions — is an essential part of making early use of the Contracts facility viable for many users.

candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): This is being done intentionally as we hope to see the same macro eventually introduced in C, with the same effective semantics, and having multiple distinct mechanisms for achieving the same results is harmful in the long term.
