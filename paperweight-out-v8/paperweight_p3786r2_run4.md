Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers a narrow but real basis for its standardization case, chiefly by showing relevance to existing and forthcoming tuple-like facilities and by providing implementation experience. Its support is thinnest in the areas that would justify a standards change over ordinary library evolution: it does not establish who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, how the change coordinates with other work, or why a library solution is insufficient.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, with both a Godbolt prototype and a libstdc++ patch credited.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives, including explicit reference to breakage already noted in P2165 and interaction with the pattern matching proposal.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established case for why the standard must act, rather than a library or implementation-level solution.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): enabling structured binding, integration with `views::elements` and pattern matching once it is approved.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): ❌ span is not compatible with pattern matching
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 30 passes): At the time of writing the only fixed-size library types that do not support structured binding are: `bitset`, `integer_sequence` and `span`.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Extending the *tuple-protocol* has one unfortunate side effect: It renders the following previously valid code ambiguous.
