Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper offers a mixed case for its own standardization, with its strongest support coming from concrete implementation experience and engagement with prior art, while much of the motivation and necessity remains asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest areas are the lack of any coordination or interoperability discussion and the repeated use of the same brief claim to cover both why the standard is needed and why a library would not suffice.

- The paper’s implementation experience is its most solid grounding, with a reference implementation available and a lineage tracing back to existing libstdc++ work.
- Its treatment of prior art and alternatives is also well supported, including explicit discussion of Unicode substitution methodology and a reasoned choice among enumerator designs.
- The claims about who is affected and why the problem matters lean on anecdotes and general assertions rather than evidence tied to the proposed facility.
- The paper offers nothing on coordination and interoperability, and its case for standardization over a library rests on a single sentence that is not developed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 45 passes): Because virtually all UTF-8 text processed by C++ is stored in `char` (and similarly for UTF-16 and `wchar_t`), this means that we need a terse way to smooth over the transition for users.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 45 passes): To avoid this situation, the `to_utfN` CPOs reject all inputs that are arrays of `char`, as do the `as_charT` casting CPOs.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 45 passes): When a transcoder encounters an invalid subsequence, the modern best practice is to replace it in the output with one or more � characters.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 45 passes): Boost.Text has hundreds of stars on GitHub.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 45 passes): An example of this anti-pattern (although not involving these specific functions) can be found in CVE-2007-3917, where a multiplayer RPG server could be crashed by malicious users sending invalid UTF.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 45 passes): Unicode functions that use exceptions for error handling are a well-known footgun because users consistently invoke them on untrusted user input without handling the exceptions properly, leading to denial-of-service vulnerabilities.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 45 passes): The methodology for doing so is described in §3.9.6 of the Unicode Standard v17.0, Substitution of Maximal Subparts [[Substitution]](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode17.0.0/core-spec/chapter-3/#G66453).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 45 passes): An alternative approach to minimize the number of enumerators could merge `truncated_utf8_sequence` with `unpaired_high_surrogate` and merge `unexpected_utf8_continuation_byte` with `unpaired_low_surrogate`, but based on feedback, splitting these up seems to be preferred.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 45 passes): Note that this depends on P4030R0 “Endian Views” for `std::views::from_big_endian`.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 45 passes): The most recent revision of this paper has a reference implementation called [beman.utf_view](https://github.com/bemanproject/utf_view) available on GitHub, which is a fork of Jonathan Wakely’s implementation of P2728R6 as an implementation detail for libstdc++.
