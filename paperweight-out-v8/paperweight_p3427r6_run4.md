Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper offers solid grounding in real-world use and prior art, but its case for standardization rests largely on assertion rather than demonstrated need. The strongest support comes from the established production history in Folly, while the thinnest areas are the absence of any coordination or interoperability discussion and the unestablished claim that a library solution would be insufficient.

- The paper clearly establishes implementation experience through Folly’s `hazptr_obj_cohort`, in heavy production use since 2018.
- The prior art and alternatives section is well supported, including a concrete comparison against the existing C++26 hazard pointer interface.
- The claim about who is affected is plausible but not established, since the paper does not demonstrate the breadth of users or use cases beyond a general example.
- The most glaring omission is the complete lack of any coordination or interoperability discussion, leaving the standardization context unaddressed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This paper proposes supporting object cohorts due to the importance of synchronous reclamation for general purpose usability.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Object cohorts have been part of the Folly open-source library (under the name `hazptr_obj_cohort`) and in heavy use in production since 2018.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): While its guarantees are weaker and less flexible than global cleanup, its efficiency enables users to use it in performance sensitive cases where the cost of global cleanup may be impractical.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Doing so avoids burdening the current thread with potentially performing amortized reclamation of tens of thousands of possibly unrelated retired objects, because calling `retire` may trigger amortized asynchronous reclamation.

candidate 2 (found by 1 of 36 passes): For example, a concurrent hash map that uses hazard pointers is more generally usable if it allows arbitrary key and value types rather than only types without dependence on resources with independent lifetimes.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 36 passes): If a cohort is long-lived, large numbers (e.g., billions) of objects may be retired to it.
