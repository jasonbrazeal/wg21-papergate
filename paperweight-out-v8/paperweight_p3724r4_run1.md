Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper offers some useful groundwork, particularly in showing that the problem is real, that existing implementations are error-prone, and that a reference implementation exists. However, the case for standardization itself is thin: the document does not establish why this belongs in the standard rather than in a library, nor does it address coordination with existing or future facilities.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, with a concrete reference implementation available for review.
- The paper also establishes meaningful prior art and alternatives, showing that similar features have been proposed before and that the design has a lineage.
- The weakest area is the absence of any established rationale for why the standard should contain this functionality, leaving the central standardization question unanswered.
- Equally unaddressed is coordination and interoperability, with no discussion of how the proposed facility would fit with existing integer division behavior or related standard library components.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): C++ currently only offers truncating integer division in the form of the `/` operator.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): There is an *ocean* of examples where C and C++ users have gotten this wrong.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 39 passes): As a rule of thumb, the proposed functionality should be a drop-in replacement for the various bad implementations that users have written themselves (§3.1. Is this not trivial for the user to do?)
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 39 passes): However, other rounding modes have various use cases too, and implementing these as the user can be surprisingly hard, especially when integer overflow needs to be avoided, and negative inputs are accepted.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 39 passes): There is an *ocean* of examples where C and C++ users have gotten this wrong.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 39 passes): An extremely common alternative is rounding towards −∞, which is the rounding mode of the division operator in some other languages
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 39 passes): In virtually every case, the rounding mode for an integer division is a fixed choice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Such a feature was previously part of [[P0105R1]](https://wg21%2elink/p0105r1) and the Numerics TS [[P1889R1]](https://wg21%2elink/p1889r1), but was eventually abandoned by the author.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): The design somewhat leans on [[P0105R1]](https://wg21%2elink/p0105r1) (which first proposed division functions with custom rounding), but heavily deviates from it.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): A reference implementation can be found on [[GitHub]](https://github%2ecom/Eisenwave/integer-division).
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 39 passes): There is an *ocean* of examples where C and C++ users have gotten this wrong. A few droplets are listed below.
