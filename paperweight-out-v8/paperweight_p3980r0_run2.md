Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers a narrow but real basis for its requested change, anchored in a recorded LEWG preference and a clear statement of the consistency benefit, but it leaves most of the standardization case unaddressed. The thinnest areas are the absence of any account of affected users, implementation experience, or why the change cannot be achieved outside the standard.

- The strongest support is the documented LEWG preference for putting `allocator_arg` first, which gives the proposal a concrete procedural foundation.
- The paper also establishes the main benefit clearly: a fixed leading position enables an optional allocator through a trailing `, auto&&...` parameter list.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any implementation experience, leaving the practical consequences of the change entirely speculative.
- Equally unaddressed are who is affected and why a library-level solution would not suffice, so the paper never connects the change to real user needs or constraints.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The current specification uses the same allocator for coroutine frame and the child environments.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The status quo is anywhere, and the request is to require that it goes first.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The main benefit is that support of an optional allocator can be supported by having a trailing `, auto&&...` on the parameter list.

  [5] 4 Use Allocator From Environment             0/1/1  -> 0.67
candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): At the LEWG meeting on 2026-02-03 the first approach (putting the `allocator_arg` first, Wording Change A) was preferred ([notes](https://wiki.isocpp.org/2026-02-03_LEWG_Telecon)).
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 15 passes): The options are a fixed location (which would fit first for consistency with existing use) and anywhere.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 15 passes): During the discussion at Kona the conclusion was that the allocator forwarded by `task`’s environment to child senders should be the allocator from `get_allocator` on the receiver `task` gets `connect`ed to.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 15 passes): The current specification uses the same allocator for coroutine frame and the child environments.
