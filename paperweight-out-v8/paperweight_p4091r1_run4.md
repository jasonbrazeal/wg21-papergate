Verdict: Strong (9/14)

The paper offers solid grounding for the problem’s importance, the existing design space, and the need to coordinate with established system interfaces, but it stops short of showing why the solution belongs in the standard or why a library cannot carry the weight. The thinnest support is around the core standardization question itself, which is left essentially unargued.

- The strongest support is the demonstration that the three-channel sender model is semantically correct for compound I/O results and that the problem is already recognized across multiple system APIs.
- The paper also credibly establishes that prior art and alternatives exist, including four distinct sender constructions and a coroutine baseline, giving readers a concrete map of the design space.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established case for why standardization is necessary, since the paper does not show that existing library mechanisms are insufficient for the proposed facility.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 54 passes): Both coroutines and senders destroy compound data at an abstraction floor - the difference is that the sender floor sits below the composition algebra, and the coroutine floor is opt-in.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The compound-result pattern is how systems report outcomes when the result carries more than a boolean.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The three-channel model is correct for this class. `std::execution` serves it well.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 54 passes): Each requires different application handling. None indicates that the operation failed to operate.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 54 passes): This paper follows that discussion and examines its implications for how the sender three-channel model interacts with compound I/O results.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The sender three-channel model ([P2300R10](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p2300r10.html) [9]) assigns semantic meaning to each channel
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The four sender implementations each use a different construction (`variant_sender`, `any_sender_of`, `execution::task`, custom sender), and a programmer encountering the problem for the first time must evaluate all four before choosing.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 54 passes): [P4090R0](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P4090R0.pdf) [17] provides the concrete measurement. Five echo-server implementations - four sender-based constructions and one coroutine-native - implement identical protocol logic.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 54 passes): io_uring delivers `(res, flags)` in one CQE. [6] IOCP delivers `(BOOL, lpNumberOfBytesTransferred, lpOverlapped)` in one call. [7] POSIX `read()` returns `ssize_t` with `errno`. [8] `std::from_chars` returns `{ptr, ec}`.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 54 passes): Both mappings demonstrate the same structural problem: any function from `(error_code, size_t)` to `{set_value, set_error,` `set_stopped}` must either lose data, embed domain-specific classification at the wrong layer, or bypass the channels entirely.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 54 passes): The sender constructions require between 2x and 3.5x the line count of the coroutine construction, with the additional lines concentrated in channel-routing and type-erasure machinery.
