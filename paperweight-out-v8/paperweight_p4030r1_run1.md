Verdict: Weak to Adequate (3/14)

The paper gives a clear rationale for why endianness views would be useful, particularly in the context of UTF transcoding, but it leaves most of the supporting case asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest areas are the absence of any implementation experience and the lack of an argument for why this cannot be handled adequately by a library.

- The strongest support is the established motivation that endianness views would make pipelines clearer and serve a concrete need for UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE, UTF-32LE, and UTF-32BE conversions.
- The paper claims a broad affected audience and interoperability with UTF transcoding and network or file formats, but it does not substantiate those claims with evidence or examples.
- The argument for standardization rests on avoiding a combinatorial explosion of UTF adaptors, yet the paper does not show why a library solution would be insufficient.
- The most glaring omission is the complete lack of implementation experience, leaving the proposal without practical validation of its design or usefulness.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): it would be harder to read the pipelines if we used names like `from_or_to_little_endian` or `byteswap_if_native_is_big_endian`.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 24 passes): But users often need to convert to and from UTF encodings with specific endianness: UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE, UTF-32LE, and UTF-32BE.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 24 passes): The main reason for adding these views is to assist users of the UTF transcoding range adaptors (see [[P2728R11]](https://wg21.link/p2728r11)).

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Rather than introduce a combinatorial explosion of UTF adaptors with various endianness of input and output, we should follow the single responsibility principle and add standard endianness views so users can handle endianness separately.
