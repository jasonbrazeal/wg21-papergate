Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers a narrow but genuine foundation for its case, chiefly by showing that the current behavior is surprising and that `std::format` already models the preferred direction. Beyond that, the support thins considerably: the document does not identify who would be affected, explain why a library solution is insufficient, or provide any implementation experience. As a result, the argument rests on motivation and precedent rather than on evidence of need for a standard change.

- The strongest support is the established motivation, with clear statements that treating `signed char` and `unsigned char` as characters is unexpected and rarely the desired behavior.
- The paper also credibly cites prior art in `std::format` and the C/C++ distinction around `char8_t` as a step toward integer-like treatment.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established affected audience, leaving the practical scope and impact of the proposed change unspecified.
- Equally missing is any demonstration of why a library cannot address the problem or why standardization, rather than another mechanism, is required.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): This behavior is unexpected, especially when using the aliases `int8_t` or `uint8_t`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): This is surprising.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): It’s easy to find counter-examples, however, where workarounds have to be employed to insert or extract `signed char`s or `unsigned char`s as integers.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): It’s difficult to find examples where this is the sought-after behavior, and would become deprecated with this change.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): `std::format` has already taken a step in the right direction here, by treating `signed char` and `unsigned char` as integers.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): It should be noted, that the C standard has defined `char8_t` to be an alias (typedef) to `unsigned char`. In C++, `char8_t` is a distinct type with an underlying type of `unsigned char`.
