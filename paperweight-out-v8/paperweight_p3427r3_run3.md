Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers solid grounding in production use and prior art, but its case for standardization rests heavily on assertions about performance and general-purpose usability rather than demonstrated need. The thinnest parts are the absence of any discussion of coordination with the existing hazard pointer facility and the lack of evidence that a library-only solution is insufficient.

- The strongest support comes from the documented, years-long production use of object cohorts in Folly, which establishes real implementation experience.
- The paper also clearly situates the proposal against the existing asynchronous-only hazard pointer interface and identifies synchronous reclamation as the motivating gap.
- The weakest established element is the claim that the standard library is the right venue, since the paper asserts rather than demonstrates why a library implementation would not suffice.
- Most glaringly, the paper offers no discussion of how the proposed facility would coordinate or interoperate with the standardized hazard pointer interface it is meant to complement.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This paper proposes supporting object cohorts due to the importance of synchronous reclamation for general purpose usability.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Object cohorts have been part of the Folly open-source library (under the name `hazptr_obj_cohort`) and in heavy use in production since 2018.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Doing so avoids burdening the current thread with potentially performing amortized reclamation of tens of thousands of possibly unrelated retired objects, because calling `retire` may trigger amortized asynchronous reclamation.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): As a result, hazard pointer users must guarantee separately that the deleters of such objects do not depends on resources that may become subsequently unavailable.

candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The P2530R3 C++26 hazard pointer interface supports only asynchronous reclamation which does not guarantee the timing of the reclamation of protectable objects that are no longer protected.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): An alternative approach is the use of object cohorts, which are sets of protectable objects.
