Verdict: Weak (1/14)

The paper offers only a narrow slice of support for its own standardization, centered on a single motivating example, and leaves nearly every other part of the case unaddressed. The thinnest areas are the absence of any discussion of affected users, prior approaches, interoperability, implementability, or why a library solution would be insufficient.

- The strongest support is the illustrative claim that an exception before joining a scope can leave asynchronous tasks touching objects whose lifetimes have ended.
- The paper does not establish who is affected by the problem or how widespread it is.
- The paper gives no account of prior art, alternative designs, or existing practice elsewhere.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any implementation experience or evidence that the proposed facility can be specified and built in practice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): Here, if `maybe_throw` throws an exception, then the scope is not joined, and the nested tasks can continue executing asynchronously, potentially accessing both the `scope` and `scoped_data` objects out of lifetime.
