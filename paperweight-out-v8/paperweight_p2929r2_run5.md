Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers a narrow but real basis for its proposal, chiefly by explaining why access to smaller SIMD chunks would help programmers use target intrinsics and by showing that the design has been considered against existing `std::simd` facilities. The support is thinnest around the case for standardization itself: the paper does not establish who is affected, how the feature would coordinate with other interfaces, why a library solution is insufficient, or that anyone has implemented the idea.

- The strongest support is the motivation, which clearly ties the proposed `chunked_invoke` to the practical need to call target-specific intrinsics on portions of a SIMD value.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives by connecting the naming and placement to existing `std::simd` functions such as `chunk` and `cat`, and by noting an earlier indexed naming choice.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of implementation experience, leaving no evidence that the proposed facility has been tried in practice.
- Equally unaddressed are who would be affected and why a library cannot provide the capability, which leaves the standardization rationale largely asserted rather than demonstrated.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Proposal to extend `std::simd` with a method of allowing a lambda to be invoked on smaller pieces of a SIMD value in order to make interaction with intrinsics easier.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Being able to define a different size is useful for two reasons:
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): This requires that the programmer is able to allow a `basic_vec` value to be used in a call to a target intrinsic, and that the result of the intrinsic call can be used to generate a new `basic_vec` value.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): However, it is inevitable that the programmer will want to make some use of target-specific intrinsics in order to unlock some of the more unusual features of those specific platforms.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The function is named `chunked_invoke` and placed in `std::simd` to directly align with related established functions such as `chunk` and `cat`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): In the first revision of this paper we proposed that the function which invokes a Callable with an explicit offset should be called with a `_indexed` suffix (e.g., `simd::chunked_invoke_indexed`).
