Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper offers solid grounding in why exception-based Unicode handling is a practical problem and in the existence of prior art and a reference implementation, but it leaves several parts of the standardization case asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest support concerns interoperability with existing standard facilities and the argument that this work cannot be adequately delivered as a library outside the standard.

- The strongest support comes from the reference implementation and its lineage from an existing libstdc++ implementation detail, which gives the proposal concrete implementation experience.
- The paper clearly establishes prior art and alternatives by discussing the deprecated `codecvt` facilities, design choices about enumerator granularity, and a dependency on P4030R0.
- The case for why this belongs in the standard, rather than remaining a library, is only claimed through the proposed role as a replacement for removed `codecvt` facets.
- The most glaring omission is any established discussion of coordination and interoperability with other standardization efforts or existing standard interfaces.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 45 passes): Because virtually all UTF-8 text processed by C++ is stored in `char` (and similarly for UTF-16 and `wchar_t`), this means that we need a terse way to smooth over the transition for users.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 45 passes): Unicode functions that use exceptions for error handling are a well-known footgun because users consistently invoke them on untrusted user input without handling the exceptions properly, leading to denial-of-service vulnerabilities.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 45 passes): These functions throw exceptions on encountering invalid UTF. Unicode functions that use exceptions for error handling are a well-known footgun because users consistently invoke them on untrusted user input without handling the exceptions properly, leading to denial-of-service vulnerabilities.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 45 passes): There are many concerns about these interfaces, particularly with respect to safety.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 45 passes): Because it doesn’t use exceptions, the functionality proposed by this paper can serve as a safe, modern replacement for the deprecated and removed `codecvt` facets.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 45 passes): An alternative approach to minimize the number of enumerators could merge `truncated_utf8_sequence` with `unpaired_high_surrogate` and merge `unexpected_utf8_continuation_byte` with `unpaired_low_surrogate`, but based on feedback, splitting these up seems to be preferred.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 45 passes): Note that this depends on P4030R0 “Endian Views” for `std::views::from_big_endian`.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 45 passes): The most recent revision of this paper has a reference implementation called [beman.utf_view](https://github.com/bemanproject/utf_view) available on GitHub, which is a fork of Jonathan Wakely’s implementation of P2728R6 as an implementation detail for libstdc++.
