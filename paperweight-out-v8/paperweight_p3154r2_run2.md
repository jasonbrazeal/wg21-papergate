Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers a narrow but genuine basis for its case, chiefly by showing that the current behavior is surprising and that `std::format` already points toward the desired treatment. Beyond that, the support thins considerably: the document does not identify who is affected, why a library solution would be inadequate, or how the change would coordinate with existing practice.

- The strongest support is the established observation that `std::format` already treats `signed char` and `unsigned char` as integers, providing relevant prior art.
- The paper also credibly notes the C and C++ divergence over `char8_t`, which helps frame the type-alias confusion.
- The implementation experience is only claimed, since the deleted-overload experiment is reported without enough detail to establish what it demonstrated.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established reason why the problem cannot be addressed in a library rather than through the standard.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): This behavior is unexpected, especially when using the aliases `int8_t` or `uint8_t`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): This is surprising.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 21 passes): It’s easy to find counter-examples, however, where workarounds have to be employed to insert or extract `signed char`s or `unsigned char`s as integers.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): `std::format` has already taken a step in the right direction here, by treating `signed char` and `unsigned char` as integers.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): It should be noted, that the C standard has defined `char8_t` to be an alias (typedef) to `unsigned char`. In C++, `char8_t` is a distinct type with an underlying type of `unsigned char`.
