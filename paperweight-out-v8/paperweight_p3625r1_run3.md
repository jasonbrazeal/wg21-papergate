Verdict: Weak to Adequate (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow basis for its own standardization: it establishes that prior art and naming alternatives were considered, but most of the case rests on a single sentence about the authors’ experience, which is asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest areas are the absence of any argument for why a library solution is insufficient and why standardization, rather than an in-house or published utility, is necessary.

- The strongest support is the discussion of prior art and alternative names, which shows the authors looked at existing practice and naming tradeoffs.
- The paper claims implementation experience and affected users, but the only evidence is the repeated statement that the need was encountered across several projects.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any case for why a library will not do, leaving the central standardization question unaddressed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): We’ve encountered the need to express a template type parameter matching one of multiple types across several projects.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): This paper proposes adding two usability concepts to more concisely express (not) matching a list of types.
