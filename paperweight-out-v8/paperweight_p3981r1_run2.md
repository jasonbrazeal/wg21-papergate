Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper gives a reasonably grounded account of why optional references would be a better return type for the algorithms it discusses, and it engages with some prior art and alternatives. The support is thinnest around the questions that matter most for standardization: whether this cannot be done in a library, how it coordinates with existing specifications, and whether there is meaningful implementation experience.

- The strongest part of the paper is its motivation, which clearly enumerates the benefits of `optional<T&>` for the affected return types and argues that it is a better choice than the current alternatives.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is also solid, including acknowledgment of earlier feedback and comparison with existing practice in Rust and prior C++ proposals.
- The case for why this belongs in the standard is only asserted, mainly through claims about hardening and the absence of benefits to raw pointers, without fully demonstrating that a library solution is inadequate.
- The most glaring omission is the complete lack of any established coordination and interoperability analysis, leaving open how this change would interact with existing standard library components and specifications.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): There are several significant benefits to `optional<T&>` when it comes to the return type here, which we will enumerate.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): But the notion of an optional reference in general is not new, and we have a lot of experience with it outside of the standard library — and even outside of C++.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 24 passes): We argue in this paper that there is a better choice for the return type for each of these algorithms: `optional<reference>` for the first three
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 24 passes): We argue in this paper that there is a better choice for the return type for each of these algorithms

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): A previous revision of this paper made the argument that `v.try_append_range(r)` should return a `subrange` instead of an `iterator` (as pointed out by PL-006).
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 24 passes): We are aware that [[P3739R4] (Standard Library Hardening - using std::optional)](https://wg21.link/p3739r4) exists, but we feel that this is an important change to make, and that paper’s motivation is weak
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 24 passes): The Rust standard library returns optional references from many APIs quite liberally.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 24 passes): When [[P0843R14] (inplace_vector)](https://wg21.link/p0843r14) was adopted, the only sensible choice for the return type was `T*`: either a pointer that points to the new element or a null pointer.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 24 passes): There are simply no benefits to returning `T*`.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 24 passes): Fourth, with standard library hardening, we know that `*x` and `x->m` will be checked if `x` is an `optional<T&>`. But there is no such guaranteed checking for raw pointers.
