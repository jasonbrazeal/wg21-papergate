Verdict: Adequate (7/14)

The paper gives a reasonably clear account of the functional gap it wants to fill and shows that a working implementation exists, but it leaves several parts of the standardization case largely unargued. The thinnest support concerns who is actually affected, why the facility belongs in the standard rather than in a library, and how it would coordinate with existing or proposed concurrency features.

- The strongest support is the explanation of why `std::multi_lock` would matter, especially the contrast with `std::scoped_lock` and the need for deferred, timed, and try-lock behavior across multiple mutexes.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives by identifying the absence of a facility combining `std::unique_lock` flexibility with multi-mutex support and by referencing P3832.
- Implementation experience is established through the linked complete implementation, though the paper does not describe how much or what kind of use that implementation has seen.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any established case for why this cannot be provided as a library, since the relevant claims are only asserted rather than demonstrated.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Unlike `std::scoped_lock`, which provides only basic RAII semantics, `std::multi_lock` offers the full flexibility of `std::unique_lock` (deferred locking, try-lock operations, timed locking, and ownership transfer) while supporting multiple mutexes simultaneously.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Uses deadlock-free acquisition of multiple mutexes
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Both approaches require all mutexes to be of the same type.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): This gap forces developers to choose between: 1. Using `std::scoped_lock` and restructuring code to avoid deferred/timed locking scenarios 2. Managing multiple `std::unique_lock` objects manually, which is verbose and error-prone

candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Replacing a `scoped_lock` with deferred and timed locking
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): [P3832](http://wg21.link/p3832) proposes to add these free functions. This proposal includes corresponding `std::multi_lock` member functions that provide this functionality, possibly by using the two proposed free functions.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 36 passes): The variadic template approach maintains type safety, allows heterogeneous mutex types, and enables compile-time optimizations that would not be possible with a runtime container.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 36 passes): Both approaches require all mutexes to be of the same type.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 36 passes): While `std::span` avoids ownership concerns and could be non-owning, it still cannot mix different mutex types (e.g., `std::mutex` and `std::timed_mutex` in the same lock).
