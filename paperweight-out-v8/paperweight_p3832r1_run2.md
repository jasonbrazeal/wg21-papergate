Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers a partial case for standardization, with its strongest support coming from the identification of a real gap in the standard library and the existence of a reference implementation. The argument is thinnest where it needs to show that the problem cannot be adequately solved by a library or that standardization would coordinate with existing practice.

- The paper clearly establishes that no standard facility exists for timed acquisition of multiple TimedLockable objects and that users must currently hand-roll deadlock-avoidance logic.
- A reference implementation is available, which provides concrete evidence that the proposed algorithms are implementable.
- The paper does not establish who specifically is affected by the absence of this facility beyond a generic reference to users needing timeout-based locking.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any discussion of coordination and interoperability with existing or proposed standard library features.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Users who require timeout-based locking of multiple mutexes must implement their own deadlock-avoidance algorithm, typically via `try_lock()`, `unlock()`, and retry. This is error-prone, verbose, and inconsistent with the existing standard library facilities.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): It may be useful if one wants to implement other algorithms that takes over where the algorithms in this paper has failed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Contrary to `std::lock` / `std::try_lock`, the proposed algorithms accept zero or more lockables.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Existing implementations of `std::lock` already use a deadlock-avoidance algorithm.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 30 passes): These algorithms support *BasicLockable* and *Lockable* objects, but there is currently no facility for timed acquisition of multiple *TimedLockable* objects.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 30 passes): Users who require timeout-based locking of multiple mutexes must implement their own deadlock-avoidance algorithm, typically via `try_lock()`, `unlock()`, and retry.
