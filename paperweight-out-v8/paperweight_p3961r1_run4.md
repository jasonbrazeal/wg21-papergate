Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers a narrow but real basis for its standardization, chiefly by showing that the change addresses a known codegen concern, fixes a concrete compile failure, and has a working implementation. The support is thinnest around the institutional questions: the paper does not establish who is affected, why this belongs in the standard rather than a library, or how it coordinates with existing specifications.

- The strongest support comes from the implementation experience, since the proposal has already been realized in a public branch and can be tested against real use.
- The paper also establishes why the change matters by pointing to a specific compile failure and a codegen improvement requested in RU-220.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is credible, particularly in comparing the behavior to `noexcept` function types and noting the shared `reference_wrapper` problem with `move_only_function`.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established case for why the standard, rather than a library solution, is necessary, leaving the standardization rationale largely unargued.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): RU-220 calls for allowing skipping indirections when constructing `function_ref` to improve codegen.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Without this paper, `r1 = r2` doesn't compile.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 24 passes): The users shouldn't expect `function_ref` to exhibit a "reference to reference" behavior.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): This paper (P3961) suggests that, in addition to the change, a subset of the "optimized" cases should be mandated.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 24 passes): Closely matching the behavior of `noexcept` function types in the core language
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 24 passes): Note that *without* unwrapping `reference_wrapper`, a user can call a non-const member `operator()` from a `function_ref` with a const signature: [eP11Kh6es](https://godbolt.org/z/eP11Kh6es)Compiler Explorer. `move_only_function` has the same problem.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 24 passes): Replacing `auto` with `function_ref` CTAD, the assignment behaviors between `noexcept` and non-`noexcept` function objects should stay the same.
