Verdict: Weak to Adequate (3/14)

The paper offers only a thin, mostly asserted case for its own standardization, with the strongest material concentrated in a brief note about implementation experience and the weakest in the complete absence of discussion about why the standard, rather than a library, is the right venue.

- The clearest support is the statement that the three functions have been implemented in Intel’s reference implementation and used in software products, though even this is asserted without detail.
- The paper gestures at prior art by citing P0543R3 and at affected users by naming common saturating operations, but neither point is developed into a concrete need.
- The most glaring omission is any argument for why standardization is necessary at all, including why a library solution would not suffice or how the feature would coordinate with existing standard facilities.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): These perform saturating arithmetic operations which are effectively performed in infinite precision, and will return the smallest or largest value when it is too large to be represented in that type.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): The most common types of saturating operations are addition, subtraction, and casting.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): The other saturating operations haven’t been implemented in the reference software as they are rarely needed.

candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The other saturating operations haven’t been implemented in the reference software as they are rarely needed.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): Proposal to add `std::simd` overloads for the saturating arithmetic operations introduced in [P0543R3].
