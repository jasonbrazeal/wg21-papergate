Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers a solid conceptual and contextual foundation for its proposal, but it leaves several practical and evidentiary requirements largely asserted rather than demonstrated. The strongest material concerns the arbitrariness of the current restriction and the existence of relevant prior work and library developments, while the thinnest support appears in the areas of affected users, implementation experience, and the necessity of a core-language change.

- The paper clearly establishes why the current prohibition is arbitrary and why the issue matters for coroutine design.
- It also establishes relevant prior art and alternatives, including an earlier proposal and the upcoming `std::execution` facility.
- The case for why only the compiler can address the restriction is claimed but not backed by a demonstration that no library-level workaround is viable.
- The paper does not establish who is affected by the restriction, leaving the practical scope and urgency of the problem unstated.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Disallowing `return_void` alongside `return_value` is fundamentally arbitrary, unnecessarily making `void` a special case.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 24 passes): Unfortunately the standard bans this by fiat (§9.6.4 [dcl.fct.def.coroutine]): *“If searches for the names* `return_void` *and* `return_value` *in the scope of the promise type* *each find any declarations, the program is ill-formed.”*
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 24 passes): Trying to accept `std::execution::set_value_t()` (i.e. successful completion with no values) alongside any other `std::execution::set_value_t(...)` form, on the other hand, does not work. Not for any conceptual reason, but simply because the standard bans it by fiat.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 24 passes): Unfortunately the standard bans this by fiat (§9.6.4 [dcl.fct.def.coroutine]): “If searches for the names return_void and return_value in the scope of the promise type each find any declarations, the program is ill-formed.”

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): There has previously been a paper by a different author with the same goal as this paper [4]. It had no consensus in Cologne in 2019, however the author of this paper feels there is new information [5][6].
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): `std::execution`, which will ship in C++26, provides “the [library] implementation of an `async-function`” ([8] at §6).
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Disallowing it either disadvantages coroutines vis-à-vis `std::execution` or necessitates library workarounds (e.g. the tag type approach discussed in the preceding section).

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 24 passes): This restriction can only be implemented by the compiler. Regular C++ code cannot check for “names” or “declarations,” it can only check for well-formed expressions.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 24 passes): The restriction in the current working draft says (emphasis added): “If searches for the names [...] find any declarations, the program is ill-formed.” Note the reference to “names” and “declarations.” This restriction can only be implemented by the compiler.
