Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a narrow, preliminary rationale for its proposal, centered on a claim that dedicated atomic comparison operations would express intent more clearly than a load followed by a manual comparison. That support is thinnest where the proposal needs to show who would use the feature, why it belongs in the standard rather than a library, and whether anyone has actually implemented or used it.

- The strongest support is the paper’s identification of existing `compare_exchange` semantics as the intended model for the proposed bitwise comparison.
- The paper asserts, but does not establish, that the feature would be clearer and less fragile than current idioms such as `owner.load() == my_id`.
- The paper does not identify any affected users, communities, or codebases that would benefit from the proposed operations.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any implementation experience, library feasibility discussion, or evidence that standardization is necessary rather than achievable through existing facilities.

  [8] Proposed Wording                             0/0/0  -> 0.00
candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): The primary motivation is to provide dedicated operations that express intent more clearly than an atomic `load` followed separately by a manual comparison of non-atomic values.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): While `'if (owner.load() == my_id)'` avoids naming a local variable, it is fragile under refactoring, for instance, when adding debug logging.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 24 passes): These functions perform an atomic comparison of the atomic object's value with an expected value, following the same bitwise comparison semantics as `compare_exchange_strong`, but without writing a new value to the atomic object.

  [8] Proposed Wording                             0/0/0  -> 0.00
candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): The existing `compare_exchange` operations, `compare_exchange_weak` and `compare_exchange_strong`, are defined in **[[atomics.types.operations]](https://eel.is/c++draft/atomics#types.operations)** p21–28.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 24 passes): Atomic bitwise equality checks offer concurrent programmers an alternative to raw-pointer equality checks (`==`), consistent with compare_exchange equality check semantics.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 24 passes): Support the same strong comparison semantics as `compare_exchange_strong`.
