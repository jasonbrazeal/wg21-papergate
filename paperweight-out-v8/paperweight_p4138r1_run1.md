Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers some useful historical grounding and a small amount of implementation evidence, but it does not yet make a persuasive case that standardization is needed. The support is thinnest around the basic rationale: it gestures at a wording quirk and a surprising overload interaction, but never shows who is harmed, why the standard is the right place to fix it, or what would break without a change.

- The strongest support is the implementation evidence, which shows broad compiler agreement on most of the examined cases and gives the discussion a concrete empirical starting point.
- The paper also establishes that the current behavior has a traceable history, reaching back to the introduction of ref-qualifiers and related core issues.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established affected audience or practical consequence, leaving the importance of the problem asserted rather than demonstrated.
- The paper likewise does not establish why a standard change is necessary or why the issue cannot be addressed through guidance, tooling, or a library-level workaround.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): it doesn’t make much sense to overload member functions with explicit object parameter of non-reference type with member functions of any other kind of object parameter with the same type, ignoring references.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): This, and the obvious rule that object parameters of the same type correspond, shape the status quo of the wording.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Note how adding a `this D` overload to an existing member function *F* flips the set of well-formed calls to its complement, because `this D` is best viable function in all cases, rendering *F* obsolete.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): Implementations agree on 18 out of 21 cases

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The intent to give member functions with no ref-qualifier special treatment can be tracked all the way to [[N1821] (Extending Move Semantics To *this (Revision 2))](https://wg21.link/n1821), which introduced ref-qualifiers
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): While looking at [[CWG3103]](https://wg21.link/cwg3103), I got interested how we arrived at status quo
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Clang considers `this D` and `this D&` to correspond (but this might be a desirable direction as discussed in Proposed changes section).
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): Implementations agree on 18 out of 21 cases ([Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/aM963qh8n))
