Verdict: Adequate (7/14)

The paper gives a reasonably clear account of the gap it wants to fill and shows that a working implementation exists, but it leaves several parts of the standardization case largely unargued. The thinnest areas are the absence of any identified user community and the lack of discussion about how this would coordinate with existing or forthcoming library work.

- The strongest support comes from the concrete comparison with `std::scoped_lock` and `std::unique_lock`, which establishes both the missing functionality and the prior art in the standard library.
- The paper also earns credit for pointing to a complete implementation, which gives the proposal some grounding in experience.
- The case for why this belongs in the standard rather than a library is asserted mainly through a claim about variadic templates and compile-time optimization, but it is not developed.
- The most glaring omission is the failure to establish who is affected, leaving the proposal without a demonstrated constituency or motivating use case.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Unlike `std::scoped_lock`, which provides only basic RAII semantics, `std::multi_lock` offers the full flexibility of `std::unique_lock` (deferred locking, try-lock operations, timed locking, and ownership transfer) while supporting multiple mutexes simultaneously.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Uses deadlock-free acquisition of multiple mutexes
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): This gap forces developers to choose between: 1. Using `std::scoped_lock` and restructuring code to avoid deferred/timed locking scenarios 2. Managing multiple `std::unique_lock` objects manually, which is verbose and error-prone
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): The standard library currently lacks `std::try_lock_for` and `std::try_lock_until` functions for multiple mutexes.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): [P3832](http://wg21.link/p3832) proposes to add these free functions. This proposal includes corresponding `std::multi_lock` member functions that provide this functionality, possibly by using the two proposed free functions.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The variadic template approach maintains type safety, allows heterogeneous mutex types, and enables compile-time optimizations that would not be possible with a runtime container.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): Unlike `std::scoped_lock`, which provides only basic RAII semantics, `std::multi_lock` offers the full flexibility of `std::unique_lock`
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): The following table illustrates how `multi_lock` completes the family of mutex wrappers:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Additionally, it is probably preferable to keep the interface similar to that of `unique_lock` and `scoped_lock` to complete the family of mutex wrapper classes with a consistent design.
