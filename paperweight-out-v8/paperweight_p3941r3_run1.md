Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers some grounding for its motivation and for the existence of prior discussion and alternatives, but it leaves most of the case for standardization unstated. The thinnest areas are the absence of any identified affected users, any argument for why this belongs in the standard rather than a library, and any evidence of implementation experience.

- The strongest support is the paper’s connection of its motivation to prior committee discussion and NB comments about `affine_on`, which establishes that the problem has been noticed in the standardization process.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives by referencing P3796R1, P3718R0, and the earlier `task` design using `continues_on`.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any implementation experience, leaving no evidence that the proposed design has been tried or validated in practice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): There were multiple concerns raised against the specification of `affine_on` and discussed as part of [P3796R1](https://wg21.link/P3796R1).
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 15 passes): There are a few NB comments raised about the way `affine_on` works:
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 15 passes): It isn’t adding any new functionality but removes a problematic way to achieve something which can be better achieved differently.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 15 passes): The discussion on `affine_on` revealed some aspects which were not quite clear previously and taking these into account points towards a better design than was previously specified:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): There were multiple concerns raised against the specification of `affine_on` and discussed as part of [P3796R1](https://wg21.link/P3796R1).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): [P3718R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3718r0.html) is, however, discontinued (for unrelated reasons) and adding the guarantee to get the current scheduler from a receiver query is proposed here.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The original proposal for `task` used `continues_on` to schedule the work back on the original scheduler.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 15 passes): [ Editor's note: This wording is relative to [N5032](https://wg21.link/N5032) with the changes from [P3826r3](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p3826r3.html) applied. ]
