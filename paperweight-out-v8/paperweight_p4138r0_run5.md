Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers solid grounding in implementation behavior and some useful analysis of the current wording and prior discussions, but it leaves several essential parts of the standardization case unaddressed. The thinnest areas are the absence of any account of who is affected, why a standard change is needed rather than a compiler or library fix, and how the change would coordinate with existing practice.

- The strongest support comes from concrete implementation evidence, including compiler agreement across most cases and Clang’s existing rejection of the relevant overloads.
- The paper also establishes that the issue arises from real wording and prior core-issue discussion, and that the current situation produces surprising or undesirable overload behavior.
- The most glaring omission is that the paper never establishes who is affected by the problem or why the standard is the right place to address it, as opposed to leaving the behavior to implementations or addressing it through non-standard means.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): This, and the obvious rule that object parameters of the same type correspond, shape the status quo of the wording.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): This will render the second example in [[CWG3103]](https://wg21.link/cwg3103) ill-formed as requested.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): adding a `this D` overload to an existing member function *F* flips the set of well-formed calls to its complement, because `this D` is best viable function in all cases, rendering *F* obsolete.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): it doesn’t make much sense to overload member functions with explicit object parameter of non-reference type with member functions of any other kind of object parameter with the same type, ignoring references.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): All implementations [agree](https://godbolt.org/z/WMz5e6s89), with an exception of Clang, which consider `this D` and `this D&` to be corresponding object parameters.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): While looking at [[CWG3103]](https://wg21.link/cwg3103), I got interested how we arrived at status quo
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Clang considers `this D` and `this D&` to correspond (but this might be a desirable direction as discussed in Proposed changes section).
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): it doesn’t make much sense to overload member functions with explicit object parameter of non-reference type with member functions of any other kind of object parameter with the same type, ignoring references.
