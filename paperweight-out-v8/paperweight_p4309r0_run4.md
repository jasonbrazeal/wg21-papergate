Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers a clear motivation for the feature and establishes why it matters, but most of the remaining case rests on assertions rather than demonstrated need or evidence. The thinnest areas are the absence of any argument for why this belongs in the standard rather than a library, and the lack of implementation experience beyond a passing reference to an annoyance.

- The strongest support is the concrete explanation of why directly constructing an owning node-handle matters, including the awkward workaround of creating and immediately destroying a container.
- The paper claims the feature has been encountered multiple times, but does not identify who is affected or provide examples of real codebases or users hitting the limitation.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is asserted rather than explored, with only a brief mention of factory functions or constructors and a link to another proposal.
- The most glaring omission is that the paper never explains why a library solution would be insufficient or why standardization is required at all.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): //allocate expensive data structure 😬 //then allocate the actual object
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): being unable to directly create an owning `node-handle` without constructing a container. Creating a container just to emplace one element that is immediately extracted, after which the container is destroyed is silly … yet is necessary with the current API
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): This paper proposes adding a way to construct owning `node-handle`s without containers.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): This feature could be provided in different ways: factory functions , or additional constructors for 2 `node-handle`.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): node-handle`s are a great way to transfer expensive-to-move or immovable objects between [node-based containers (which is one of the motivations in P3049 for adding this API to lists).](http://wg21.link/P3049)
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): [node-based containers (which is one of the motivations in P3049 for adding this API to lists).](http://wg21.link/P3049)
