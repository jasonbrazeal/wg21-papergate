Verdict: Adequate to Strong (8/14)

The paper gives a reasonably grounded account of why the layering question matters and what alternatives exist, but it leaves several central burdens—especially the need for standardization itself, coordination with the C++26 contracts machinery, and implementation experience—more asserted than demonstrated. The thinnest area is the absence of any case for why a library cannot satisfy the need, which is not established at all.

- The strongest support is the reconstruction of the proposal’s poll history and the showing that no poll adopted the architecture, which makes the procedural stakes concrete.
- The paper also clearly situates the layering question between competing published designs and identifies a specific withdrawn mechanism that leaves an existing dependency unsatisfied.
- The claims about deployment cost and vendor implementation experience are plausible but remain essentially unverified beyond the paper’s own citations.
- The most glaring omission is the complete lack of argument for why the facility requires language standardization rather than a library or existing tooling.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 42 passes): The deployment record speaks to which architecture matches existing practice.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 42 passes): The claim decides who owns the configuration of runtime checking.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 42 passes): The concern behind the ask rests on one assumption, stated plainly so a delegate can test it: a design settled through accumulated approvals, with no single poll deciding it, is harder to revisit than one decided by an explicit ballot.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 42 passes): Without explicit input from EWG, approving the outcomes of the case-by-case review may close the evolution path for Profiles.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 42 passes): This paper reconstructs the proposal's seven-poll history and shows none adopted the architecture, reports that no published paper contests the characterization, and illustrates that the layering question is substantive, contested, and grounded in a decade of deployment evidence.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 42 passes): The layering claim sits between two competing bodies of published work: P3100R8's implicit contract assertions, configured through the Labels facility of P3400R3, and the Profiles work of P3984R0, P3081R2, and P3589R2.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 42 passes): P3100R8's Section 5.6 withdrew the `detection_mode` enumerators that P3081R2's wording still depends on, leaving that dependency without the mechanism that would satisfy it.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 42 passes): Poll 2 is a process commitment: the layering gets its own paper and its own poll, from whichever side proposes it.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 42 passes): Every one of these is a named, vendor-defined check-set. None routes through the `std::contracts` violation handler adopted for C++26, and none is configured by a Label.
