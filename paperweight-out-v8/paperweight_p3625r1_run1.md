Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a narrow slice of the case needed for standardization: it gestures at a real usability problem and points to some external discussion, but it does not establish who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, or that the feature has been tried in practice. The support is thinnest around the questions that usually decide whether a small convenience concept belongs in the standard library or language.

- The strongest support is the prior art and alternatives section, which names discarded names and cites both cppreference and a Stack Overflow question showing existing interest in the semantics.
- The motivation is claimed but not established, since the paper asserts the need across several projects without showing those projects or the concrete costs of the current workaround.
- The paper does not establish who is affected, leaving unclear whether this is a broad C++ community need or a localized convenience.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any implementation experience, coordination discussion, or argument for why a library solution would not suffice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): We’ve encountered the need to express a template type parameter matching one of multiple types across several projects.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 27 passes): This paper proposes adding two usability concepts to more concisely express (not) matching a list of types.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): We’ve considered the following alternative names and discarded them for the given reasons.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): We want to point to both the documentation for `same_as` [on cppreference as](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concepts/same_as) [as well as stackoverflow for prior usage/requests to express this semantics.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73377786/c-concept-that-a-type-is-same-as-any-one-of-several-types)
