Verdict: Excellent (12/14)

The paper offers substantial support for most of the standardization case, with concrete evidence for the performance problem, the affected audience, prior art, the need for a standard rather than ad hoc solutions, the insufficiency of library-only approaches, and implementation experience. The support is thinnest around coordination and interoperability, where the paper gestures at relationships with other languages and resource systems but does not actually establish how a C++ standard feature would need to coordinate with them.

- The strongest support is the demonstrated performance and memory failure of existing array-literal and toolchain-based approaches, backed by compiler timing results and implementation experience in Clang and GCC.
- The paper also clearly establishes why a library-only solution cannot address the core problem and why standardization is preferable to repeated quality-of-implementation work.
- The most glaring omission is the coordination and interoperability claim, which is asserted through examples from other languages but never developed into a concrete case for what standardization would require.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The above clearly demonstrates the superiority of `std::embed` over latest optimized trunk builds of various compilers.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): One of the biggest benefits of `std::embed` is that it’s a normal, regular `consteval` function call.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): Many different tools and practices were adapted to handle this, as far back as 1995 with the `xxd` tool.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): Binary data as C(++) arrays provide the overhead of having to comma-delimit every single byte present, it also requires that the compiler verify every entry in that array is a valid literal or entry according to the C++ language.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): A very large amount of C and C++ programmer -- at some point -- attempts to `#include` large chunks of non-C++ data into their code.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Below are timing results for a file of random bytes using a specific strategy.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): A simpler, C-friendly, preprocessor-only version of this functionality was standardized in C++26 and C23 with `#embed <file> params...`, which solved the problem for C and C-adjacent use cases.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): It was Circle’s conclusion that a generic API was unsuitable and suffered from the same performance pitfalls that currently plagued current-generation compilers today.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): It proposed the syntax `F"my_file.txt"` and `bF"my_file.txt"`, with a few other amenities, to load files at compilation time.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The implementation-defined conversion of the `resource_identifier` to an appropriate sequence of characters to both search for the resource and perform the input dependency check allows for robust checking of resource names identified by the quote research source.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Should this really be delegated to Quality of Implementation that will be need to be solved N times over by every implementation in their own particularly special way?
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): There is precedent for specifying library features that are implemented only through compile-time compiler intrinsics (`type_traits`, `source_location`, and similar utilities).
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): This paper proposes `<embed>` to make this process much more efficient, portable, recursive, non-dependent on fixed preprocessor strings and streamlined.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 36 passes): A simpler, C-friendly, preprocessor-only version of this functionality was standardized in C++26 and C23 with `#embed <file> params...`, which solved the problem for C and C-adjacent use cases.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): It also absolutely destroys state-of-the-art compilers due to the extremely high memory overhead of producing an Abstract Syntax Tree for a braced initializer list of several tens of thousands of integral constants with numeric values at 255 or less.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The above clearly demonstrates the superiority of `std::embed` over latest optimized trunk builds of various compilers.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This scales a little bit better in terms of raw compilation time but is shockingly OS, vendor and platform specific in ways that novice developers would not be able to handle fully.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Finally, a proper implementation has been completed in LLVM/Clang trunk and in GCC trunk as of April 25th, 2026, though they are not integrated into main/trunk of either compiler yet.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The current implementation uses `-fembed-path=some/path/here/` to indicate this, but when it is standardized there will probably be an `-RI` or `-resource-include` flag instead.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 36 passes): As the current implementation does, manipulating `--embed-dir=` similar to the way `#include` is handled alongside `-I` flags is a much better use of not only implementer time, but programmer time.
