Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper gives a narrow but real justification for changing the status quo, centered on avoiding a hang in generic code and removing an unnecessary special case. Beyond that, however, the case for standardization is largely undeveloped: the affected audience, implementation experience, and the need for a standard-library solution rather than a library-level workaround are all left unaddressed.

- The strongest support is the concrete claim that the current restriction can cause an asynchronous operation to hang when `when_all()` is used generically.
- The paper also argues plausibly that the empty case has a natural semantics equivalent to `just()`, making the ban feel like a special case.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any implementation experience or evidence about who is actually affected by the restriction in practice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): If this restriction were not present the asynchronous operation which results from connecting the result of `std::execution::when_all()` and starting the operation state yielded thereby would hang
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 18 passes): Banning `std::execution::when_all()` (i.e. the status quo) unnecessarily creates a special case when writing generic algorithms.

  [6] Acknowledgements                             0/0/0  -> 0.00
candidate 1 (found by 2 of 18 passes): The standard currently specifies, by fiat, that `std::execution::when_all()` is ill-formed (§33.9.12.12 [exec.when.all])
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 18 passes): it is simply equivalent to `std::execution::just()`.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 18 passes): Given zero senders “all input senders” have always trivially completed (in the same way that `std::all_of` returns `true` for empty input) and therefore there’s no reason to ban `std::execution::when_all()`, it is simply equivalent to `std::execution::just()`.
