Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers meaningful support in a few areas, particularly in showing that the problem is real, that existing type-erasure facilities are recurring and inconsistent, and that a reference implementation exists. The case is much thinner when it comes to explaining who specifically is affected, why the feature belongs in the standard rather than in a library, and how it would coordinate with adjacent work like `proxy`.

- The strongest support is the concrete reference implementation and the clear identification of a gap around representing overload sets.
- The paper also establishes that the proposed reflection-based approach differs from prior template-heavy designs and points to existing standard facilities as evidence of recurring need.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of a demonstrated reason why a library solution, including the cited `proxy` work, cannot adequately fill the need without language or standard-library changes.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Any type that provides member functions with the same names and function signatures as those specified by the interface is considered to be *conforming* to the protocol.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This paper explores a different approach to proxy and relies on reflection rather than templates for a smaller API surface.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Standard librarie facilities such as `std::function`, `std::any`, `std::ranges::any_view` and the many other type-erasure based solutions demonstrate that the need for dynamic structural interfaces is both real and recurring.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): There is currently no function-type in the standard library that can represent an overload set.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Ideally both `protocol` and `protocol_view` would be generated by the compiler using static reflection, eliminating hand-written type-erasure boilerplate or custom build steps.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 36 passes): The absence of a language-supported mechanism for dynamic structural typing explains the proliferation of type-erasure-based abstractions.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): It requires language support for code injection from static reflection and the addition of a new standard library header `<protocol>`.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 36 passes): This paper proposes protocol types as a first-class library feature that fills this gap.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 36 passes): `proxy` instead requires the author to build a *Facade* explicitly using the `pro::facade_builder` template, combining dispatch objects such as `pro::member_dispatch` with `add_convention` calls.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 36 passes): However, these solutions are implemented in an ad-hoc manner, requiring significant boilerplate and leading to inconsistent semantics across libraries.
