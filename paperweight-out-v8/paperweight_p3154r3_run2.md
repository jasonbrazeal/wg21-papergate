Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers a solid motivational and contextual foundation, but it leaves the core standardization argument largely unaddressed. The strongest material concerns why the current behavior is surprising and how `std::format` already models the desired direction, while the thinnest areas are the absence of any case for why this needs to be in the standard, why a library solution would not suffice, or how it would interoperate in practice.

- The paper clearly establishes that treating `signed char` and `unsigned char` as characters rather than integers is surprising and rarely the intended behavior.
- It also establishes meaningful prior art by pointing to `std::format`’s existing treatment of these types as integers and noting the C++20 updates to related stream overloads.
- The paper claims only a small number of affected uses were found, but does not establish who is actually affected or how representative that finding is.
- Most glaringly, the paper does not establish why standardization is necessary, why a library-level fix would be inadequate, or how the change would coordinate with existing practice and implementation experience.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): This behavior is unexpected, especially when using the aliases `int8_t` or `uint8_t`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): This is surprising.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): It’s difficult to find examples where this is the sought-after behavior, and would become deprecated with this change.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): It’s easy to find counter-examples, however, where workarounds have to be employed to insert or extract `signed char`s or `unsigned char`s as integers.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): `std::format` has already taken a step in the right direction here, by treating `signed char` and `unsigned char` as integers.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): These overloads have existed since C++98. The signature of `operator>>` for `basic_istream` was updated for C++20 in [P0487R1], where these functions were changed to take `T (&)[N]` instead of `T*`, for safety reasons.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): It should be noted, that the C standard has defined `char8_t` to be an alias (typedef) to `unsigned char`. In C++, `char8_t` is a distinct type with an underlying type of `unsigned char`.
