Verdict: Adequate to Strong (8/14)

The paper offers solid support for the core technical motivation, particularly the unresolved defect reports and the need for core-language changes to fix library wording, but its broader case rests on assertions that are not backed up with evidence. The thinnest areas are the claims about implementation behavior, affected users, and interoperability with the existing library feature.

- The strongest support is the connection to CWG 3003 and LWG 4381, with a clear statement that no library-only fix is known.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is well grounded, especially the reference to P0552R0 and the consistency with CTAD for alias templates.
- The paper claims all current implementations accept the relevant examples, but provides no supporting evidence or survey of implementations.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of established evidence for who is affected or how the proposed change coordinates with the C++23 library feature it cites.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 33 passes): addressing both CWG 3003 and LWG 4381.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 33 passes): There is no known fix for the library wording without changes to the core language, see LWG 4381.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): This currently crashes most implementations, but as the *defining-type-id* of Alias doesn’t denote a deducible template, it should just be ill-formed.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 33 passes): This means that default template arguments specified on the template template parameters are ignored during deduction and that types can be deduced that can’t otherwise be written using the name of the template template parameter.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): But since [P0552R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0522r0.html) "DR: Matching of template template-arguments excludes compatible templates", a template template argument doesn’t have to match a template template parameter exactly; the template template parameter just needs to be more specialized than the template template argument.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Current implementations accept the above examples (except for the last one) with the "simple substitution" semantics.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): This is consistent with how CTAD for alias templates works, and the proposal is to use those semantics instead of directly substituting the template template argument.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 33 passes): it was pointed out that it was not the design intent of P0091R3 "Template argument deduction for class templates (Rev. 6)" to disallow CTAD for template template parameters.
