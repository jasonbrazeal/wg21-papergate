Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers only a narrow basis for its own standardization, with the strongest support coming from a concrete implementation and the rest of the case resting on assertions that are not developed into a full argument. The thinnest areas are the absence of any identified affected audience, a justification for why this belongs in the standard rather than a library, and any discussion of coordination or interoperability.

- The paper’s implementation experience is its most solid support, since the proposed solution exists in the `std::execution` reference implementation.
- The motivation is asserted through a specific interaction problem between `task_scheduler` and `parallel_scheduler`, but the paper does not establish who is affected by it.
- The paper gestures at prior art and alternatives by referencing `parallel_scheduler` and P3941R3, but does not build a comparative case for the proposed approach.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any argument for why the standard should address this rather than a library, alongside silence on coordination and interoperability.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): if a `task_scheduler` wraps a `parallel_scheduler` and is used to launch parallel work with a `bulk` sender, the work is not parallelized as it would be had a `parallel_scheduler` been used directly.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 21 passes): Currently, `task_scheduler` is specified to have an exposition-only member *`sch_`* of type `shared_ptr&lt;void>`.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): These are precisely the operations we would like `task_scheduler` to handle.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Like `task_scheduler`, the `parallel_scheduler` is a type-erased wrapper for a scheduler-like object.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): This paragraph is taken from [[P3941R3]](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P3941R3.html).
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): if a `task_scheduler` wraps a `parallel_scheduler` and is used to launch parallel work with a `bulk` sender, the work is not parallelized as it would be had a `parallel_scheduler` been used directly.
