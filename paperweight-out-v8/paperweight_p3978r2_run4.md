Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers a solid rationale for addressing an inconsistency in how `constant_wrapper` behaves with call and subscript operators, and it shows some grounding in prior proposals and implementation experience. The support thins considerably, however, when it comes to showing who is actually affected, why a library-only solution is insufficient, and how the feature would coordinate with existing or future standardization work.

- The strongest support is the clearly articulated language inconsistency that leaves `operator()` and `operator[]` unable to benefit from the same unwrapping behavior available to other operators.
- The paper also credibly situates itself against prior art and reports implementation experience in a shipping library.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established audience or user impact, leaving the practical need for standardization ungrounded.
- The paper likewise does not establish why a library cannot solve the problem or how the proposal interoperates with related standardization efforts.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The most glaring question on this issue is why would we do this for `operator()` and `operator[]` but for none of the other operators. This seems inconsistent.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): As discussed in [P3948R0], because of language inconsistencies, std::constant_wrapper is inconsistently not unwrapping for call and subscript operators whereas all other operators can be found via ADL and the conversion operator implemented in constant_wrapper.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): We should reconsider the placement of `constant_wrapper` in `<type_traits>`.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): because of language inconsistencies, std::constant_wrapper is inconsistently not unwrapping for call and subscript operators whereas all other operators can be found via ADL and the conversion operator implemented in constant_wrapper.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): For reference in libstdc++ we have the following dependencies:
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): With this paper, `constant_wrapper` almost achieves parity with what was proposed for `fn_t` / `function_wrapper` by Schultke et al. [P3774R0] and Müller [P3843R2].
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): [P3978R1] proposed to use *INVOKE* for the unwrapping call operator and otherwise apply `operator()` directly on `value`. This is inconsistent and not proposed anymore.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): Relative to [P3978R1], this paper’s wording has the following change:

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 27 passes): `constant_wrapper` is not a trait. `integral_constant` is not a trait either, but it is the type of many traits. `constant_wrapper` is a utility (`<utility>`).
