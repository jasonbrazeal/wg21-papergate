Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers solid grounding for the existence of a production-tested technique and for the limits of the existing asynchronous interface, but it does not carry that evidence through to the specific case that this facility belongs in the standard rather than remaining a library component. The thinnest support concerns the arguments that standardization is necessary, that a library implementation would not suffice, and that the proposed design coordinates cleanly with the existing hazard pointer machinery.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, with Folly’s `hazptr_obj_cohort` in production use since 2018.
- The paper also clearly establishes why the feature matters and what prior art it builds on, particularly the contrast with P2530R3’s asynchronous-only guarantees.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of an established case for why a library will not do, since the cited efficiency and production use do not by themselves show a need for standardization.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This paper proposes supporting object cohorts due to the importance of synchronous reclamation for general purpose usability.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Object cohorts have been part of the Folly open-source library (under the name `hazptr_obj_cohort`) and in heavy use in production since 2018.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): While its guarantees are weaker and less flexible than global cleanup, its efficiency enables users to use it in performance sensitive cases where the cost of global cleanup may be impractical.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Doing so avoids burdening the current thread with potentially performing amortized reclamation of tens of thousands of possibly unrelated retired objects, because calling `retire` may trigger amortized asynchronous reclamation.

candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The P2530R3 C++26 hazard pointer interface supports only asynchronous reclamation which does not guarantee the timing of the reclamation of protectable objects that are no longer protected.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The following table shows two code snippets one using the P2530R3 C++26 hazard pointer interface and one using object cohorts, respectively.
