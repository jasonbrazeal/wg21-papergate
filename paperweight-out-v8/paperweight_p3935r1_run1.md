Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers only partial support for its own standardization, with its strongest grounding in prior art and alternatives, while much of the case for urgency, affected users, and feasibility rests on assertions rather than demonstrated need. The thinnest areas are the absence of any discussion of who is affected, why a library cannot suffice, or how the feature would coordinate with existing practice.

- The paper clearly establishes prior art by tracing the additions to C23, P3348R4, and P3008R6, and noting implementation in gnulibc.
- The rationale for why the standard should adopt these functions is asserted mainly through the claim that they are ISO/IEC 60559-specific, without showing why that requires standardization here.
- The paper does not identify any affected user group or portability scenario beyond a general statement that differing C and C++ functions would be “needlessly difficult.”
- The most glaring omission is the complete lack of discussion of implementation experience in C++ or why a library-based solution would be inadequate.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): There are many useful C23 `<math.h>` features that should be provided in C++.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): The goal of this proposal is to pull in all the new C23 `<math.h>` features which are useful not only to decimal floating-point numbers.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): It would make porting C code to C++ and vice versa needlessly difficult if the suffixed functions only existed in one standard, for seemingly no technical reason.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): [[P3348R4]](https://wg21%2elink/p3348r4) rebased the C++26 standard on C23; it previously referred to C17.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): These functions were added to C++26 by [[P3008R6]](https://wg21%2elink/p3008r6), mostly to specify the behavior of atomic floating-point minimum/maximum in terms of the C23 functions.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): All non-template additions are taken from C23, and most have been implemented in gnulibc.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 33 passes): `*common-double-type*` is meant to emulate the behavior of the `<tgmath.h>` macros `fadd`, `fsub`, etc.
