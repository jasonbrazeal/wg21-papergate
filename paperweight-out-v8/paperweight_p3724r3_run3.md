Verdict: Adequate to Strong (8/14)

The paper offers meaningful support in a few areas, particularly prior art and implementation experience, but it leaves several essential parts of the standardization case largely unargued. The thinnest support concerns why this belongs in the standard rather than a library, and how it would coordinate with existing or future language and library features.

- The strongest support is the reference implementation, which gives concrete evidence that the proposed functions can be written and tested.
- The discussion of prior art is also well grounded, showing that similar ideas have appeared in earlier proposals and that the design consciously departs from them.
- The paper does not establish why standardization is necessary, since it does not explain what users cannot already achieve through ordinary library code.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any coordination or interoperability discussion, leaving unclear how these functions would fit with existing integer division, overflow behavior, or other rounding facilities.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): C++ currently only offers truncating integer division in the form of the `/` operator.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): There is an *ocean* of examples where C and C++ users have gotten this wrong.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 39 passes): However, other rounding modes have various use cases too, and implementing these as the user can be surprisingly hard, especially when integer overflow needs to be avoided, and negative inputs are accepted.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 39 passes): The design aims of this proposal are to provide *concise*, *simple*, *efficient*, *robust* functions which are useful *in practice*.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 39 passes): At the time of writing, the *first* Google search result for "c++ ceiling integer division" yields [[StackOverflowCeil]](https://stackoverflow%2ecom/q/2745074/5740428).
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 39 passes): An extremely common alternative is rounding towards −∞, which is the rounding mode of the division operator in some other languages.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Such a feature was previously part of [[P0105R1]](https://wg21%2elink/p0105r1) and the Numerics TS [[P1889R1]](https://wg21%2elink/p1889r1), but was eventually abandoned by the author.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): There is an *ocean* of examples where C and C++ users have gotten this wrong.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): The design somewhat leans on [[P0105R1]](https://wg21%2elink/p0105r1) (which first proposed division functions with custom rounding), but heavily deviates from it.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 39 passes): A reference implementation can be found on [[GitHub]](https://github%2ecom/Eisenwave/integer-division).
