Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a narrow foundation for its own standardization: it establishes that the inconsistencies it addresses are real and worth fixing, but it does not establish who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, or whether the proposed approach has been tried. The thinnest areas are the complete absence of implementation experience and any discussion of why a library solution would be inadequate.

- The strongest support is the paper’s identification of genuine inconsistencies and gaps introduced by independently adopted proposals.
- The paper gestures at prior art by pointing to those same independently adopted papers, but it does not actually survey alternatives or explain how they inform this fix.
- The paper never establishes who is affected by the problem or what practical impact the inconsistencies have on users.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any implementation experience, leaving the proposal without evidence that the change is workable in practice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): Given that this is a useful (and occasionally asked for) piece of information, we should just provide it directly, rather than having this API proliferate.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 18 passes): Because these were all (somewhat) independent papers that were adopted at the same time, there were a few inconsistencies that were introduced.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 18 passes): there were a few inconsistencies that were introduced. Some gaps in coverage. Some inconsistent APIs.
