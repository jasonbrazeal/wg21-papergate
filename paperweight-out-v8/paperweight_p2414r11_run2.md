Verdict: Strong (9/14)

The paper offers a solid foundation for why the problem matters and shows meaningful engagement with prior work, but it leaves several essential parts of the standardization case more asserted than demonstrated. The thinnest support concerns who is actually affected, why a library cannot suffice, and whether there is real implementation experience behind the proposed semantics.

- The strongest support is the clear explanation of why the current treatment of pointers to lifetime-ended objects is inconsistent with long-standing usage and undermines important algorithms.
- The paper also establishes credible prior art by connecting its approach to related C and C++ efforts and to historical concurrent algorithms.
- The case for why the standard itself must change, rather than a library solution, rests mostly on repeated claims about `volatile` and device drivers rather than on demonstrated necessity.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of concrete evidence about the affected codebases, production usage, or implementation experience that would substantiate the claimed prevalence and de facto status quo.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): it is not consistent with long-standing usage, especially for a range of concurrent and sequential algorithms that rely on loads, stores, equality comparisons, and even dereferencing of such pointers.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): In order to support a number of critically important algorithms, this paper proposes a convenience mechanism in which `std::atomic<T*>` and `volatile` have special behavior so that the associated pointer values become prospective
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Note that `volatile` accesses must necessarily forgive invalidity in order to support passing of virtual addresses to and from I/O devices.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 39 passes): This code is buggy because it is subject to lifetime-end pointer zap:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): concurrent algorithms that rely on loading, storing, casting, and comparing such pointer values have been used in production in large bodies of code for decades
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 39 passes): This idiom is used in the wild, for example, in cases where instrumenting this member function assists with debugging and performance-analysis tasks.

candidate 3 (found by 1 of 39 passes): We believe this to be de facto status quo given the current semantics required of `volatile` by real-world device drivers.
