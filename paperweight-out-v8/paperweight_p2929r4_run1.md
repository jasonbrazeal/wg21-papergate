Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a narrow, mostly asserted rationale for its proposal, with the strongest material going to naming and placement rather than to the need for standardization itself. The support is thinnest around the questions that matter most for a standards-track change: who is affected, why a library solution is insufficient, and whether there is any implementation experience.

- The paper’s clearest support is its alignment of the proposed name and location with existing `std::simd` facilities such as `chunk` and `cat`.
- The paper gestures at a use case involving interaction with intrinsics, but does not establish why that use case matters broadly enough to justify standardization.
- The paper does not identify an affected audience, leaving the scope and impact of the change unclear.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any argument for why this cannot be provided as a library facility outside the standard.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Proposal to extend `std::simd` with a method of allowing a lambda to be invoked on smaller pieces of a SIMD value in order to make interaction with intrinsics easier.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Being able to define a different size is useful for two reasons:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The function is named `chunked_invoke` and placed in `std::simd` to directly align with related established functions such as `chunk` and `cat`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The draft standard of `std::simd` recommends that provision is made for conversions to and from implementation defined types.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): In the first revision of this paper we proposed that the function which invokes a Callable with an explicit offset should be called with a `_indexed` suffix (e.g., `simd::chunked_invoke_indexed`).
