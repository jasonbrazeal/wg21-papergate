Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a thin rationale for its own standardization, with most of the necessary case left unaddressed. The strongest material appears in the motivation and prior-art sections, but even those are asserted rather than demonstrated, and the document is largely silent on who would be affected, why the standard is the right venue, or whether the idea has been tried.

- The clearest support is the motivation that defaulted copy assignment is currently unavailable for classes with const or reference members and that this forces extra code.
- The paper gestures at prior art by citing the lifetime rules and a Core Guideline, but does not develop those references into a comparison or justification.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any implementation experience, leaving no evidence that the proposed change is feasible or has been validated in practice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): Allow compilers to be able to generate the default copy assignment operator for classes that have `const` and `&` members by making the class `transparently replaceable` if it has a default copy constructor.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): Without this functionality, besides being more code, constness has to be enforced via even more code instead of it being enforced by use of the `const` keyword or the constness associated with references.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 15 passes): This features removes a current limitation of default member functions.
