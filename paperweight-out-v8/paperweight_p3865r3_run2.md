Verdict: Adequate (7/14)

The paper offers solid support on the core motivation and on prior art, but its case thins considerably when it comes to showing who is affected, why a library-only solution is impossible, and whether the proposed semantics have been implemented. The strongest material connects the proposal to existing defect reports and to a parallel paper, while the weakest areas leave the practical need and implementation status largely asserted rather than demonstrated.

- The paper clearly establishes that the issue matters because it blocks a library specification fix and currently causes crashes or ill-formed behavior in implementations.
- It also establishes credible prior art by tying the change to earlier design intent, template template argument matching rules, and a closely related proposal.
- The paper claims but does not establish that no library-only workaround exists, leaving the necessity of core language changes asserted rather than shown.
- It does not establish who is affected, and its implementation experience is only claimed, with no evidence for the exact semantics being proposed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This paper proposes to update the core language wording to allow CTAD (class template argument deduction) for type template template parameters and treat it as a DR, addressing both CWG 3003 and LWG 4381.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): There is no known fix for the library wording without changes to the core language, see LWG 4381.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This currently crashes most implementations, but as the *defining-type-id* of Alias doesn’t denote a deducible template, it should just be ill-formed.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This means that default template arguments specified on the template template parameters are ignored during deduction and that types can be deduced that can’t otherwise be written using the name of the template template parameter.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): it was pointed out that it was not the design intent of P0091R3 "Template argument deduction for class templates (Rev. 6)" to disallow CTAD for template template parameters.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): But since [P0552R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0522r0.html) "DR: Matching of template template-arguments excludes compatible templates", a template template argument doesn’t have to match a template template parameter exactly; the template template parameter just needs to be more specialized than the template template argument.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This is consistent with how CTAD for alias templates works, and the proposal is to use those semantics instead of directly substituting the template template argument.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Corentin Jabot has a very similar paper [P3863R0](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3863r0.pdf) "Minimal fix for CWG3003 (CTAD from template template parameters)".
