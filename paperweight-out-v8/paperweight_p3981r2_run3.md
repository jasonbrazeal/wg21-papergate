Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper gives a reasonably grounded argument for why optional references would be a better return type in the APIs it discusses, but it does not build a complete case that this change belongs in the standard. The strongest material concerns motivation and prior art, while the discussion of affected users, interoperability, and why a library solution is insufficient is essentially absent.

- The paper clearly establishes why the change matters for the specific algorithms it targets, with concrete benefits tied to `optional<T&>` as a return type.
- It draws on credible prior art from Rust and from the earlier `inplace_vector` design, and it engages with at least one alternative proposal.
- The claim that there is implementation experience is asserted only through general familiarity with optional references outside the standard library, without evidence of experience with this specific API change.
- The paper never identifies who is affected, how the change coordinates with existing standard library conventions, or why the behavior could not be provided adequately by a library outside the standard.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): There are several significant benefits to `optional<T&>` when it comes to the return type here, which we will enumerate.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): But the notion of an optional reference in general is not new, and we have a lot of experience with it outside of the standard library — and even outside of C++.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 24 passes): We argue in this paper that there is a better choice for the return type for each of these algorithms
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 24 passes): We argue in this paper that there is a better choice for the return type for each of these algorithms: `optional<reference>` for the first three

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): The Rust standard library returns optional references from many APIs quite liberally.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 24 passes): When [[P0843R14] (inplace_vector)](https://wg21.link/p0843r14) was adopted, the only sensible choice for the return type was `T*`: either a pointer that points to the new element or a null pointer.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 24 passes): We are aware that [[P3739R4] (Standard Library Hardening - using std::optional)](https://wg21.link/p3739r4) exists, but we feel that this is an important change to make, and that paper’s motivation is weak
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 24 passes): A previous revision of this paper made the argument that `v.try_append_range(r)` should return a `subrange` instead of an `iterator` (as pointed out by PL-006).
