Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper gives a partial account of why these C23 math features should enter C++, with its strongest material concentrated in motivation, prior art, and alternatives. The case thins considerably around the need for a standard rather than a library, the affected audience, and evidence that the proposed design has been implemented or validated in practice.

- The paper clearly establishes that useful C23 math facilities are missing from C++ and identifies a real representational problem with prvalues and classification functions.
- It also shows meaningful engagement with prior work, including P3348R4, earlier overload designs, and the relationship to C23 and gnulibc.
- The paper does not establish who is affected by the absence of these features, leaving the practical stakes largely implicit.
- Most glaringly, it offers no established argument for why a library could not provide the needed functionality, nor credible implementation experience beyond a bare claim about gnulibc.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): There are many useful C23 `<math.h>` features that should be provided in C++.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): The goal of this proposal is to pull in all the new C23 `<math.h>` features which are useful not only to decimal floating-point numbers.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): The problem is that when lvalue-to-rvalue conversion takes place, only the *value*, not the exact bit pattern (value representation) of an object is being carried by prvalues.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 33 passes): A pre-existing defect is that classification functions such as `signbit` take their parameter by value.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): [[P3348R4]](https://wg21%2elink/p3348r4) rebased the C++26 standard on C23; it previously referred to C17.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): To solve this, R1 of the paper proposed additional function templates such as: ... However, this would create a strange overload set with the existing `fadd` functions (where the `f` prefix indicates `float`).
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): All non-template additions are taken from C23, and most have been implemented in gnulibc.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 33 passes): `*common-double-type*` is meant to emulate the behavior of the `<tgmath.h>` macros `fadd`, `fsub`, etc.
