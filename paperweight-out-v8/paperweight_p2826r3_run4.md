Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper gives a partial but uneven account of why expression aliases belong in the standard, with its strongest material concentrated in motivation and comparison to existing work, while leaving several core justifications essentially unargued. The thinnest areas are the absence of any identified user population, any explanation of why standardization is necessary, and any implementation experience.

- The paper clearly establishes why the feature matters for wrapping C APIs and for introducing bound names through the function declarator.
- It offers credible prior art and alternatives, including the contrast with current practice and the reference to P2481R1.
- Its claims about ABI coordination and why a library cannot suffice are asserted rather than demonstrated.
- The paper never establishes who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, or that anyone has implemented the feature.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This capability would make wrapping C APIs much easier, since we could just make overload sets out of individually-named functions.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 33 passes): The function declarator naturally introduces names for bound expressions and their substitution.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 33 passes): The `using` syntax aligns with type aliases.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Contrast with the best we can realistically do presently:
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This paper is strictly orthogonal, as it doesn’t give you a way to rewire the arguments at the language level in a new way, just substitute the expression that’s actually invoked.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This topic is explored in Barry Revzin’s [P2481R1].
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 33 passes): The `using` syntax aligns with type aliases.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This dispatch function, however it’s employed, has no way to distinguish prvalues from other rvalues and therefore cannot possibly emulate the copy-elision aspects of *expression-equivalent*.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 33 passes): The second example results in a separate function for each format string (which is, say, one per log statement). The expression alias provably never instantiates different function bodies for different format strings.
