Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper offers a solid core motivation and some useful evidence that the problem is real and that implementers are already engaging with it, but it leaves several essential parts of the standardization case largely unargued. The thinnest support concerns why a standard change is necessary at all and how it would interact with existing practice.

- The strongest support is the clear demonstration that the degenerate form of `std::bit_cast` turns padding into unconditional undefined behavior, making the change a safety improvement rather than a new feature.
- The paper also benefits from concrete implementation experience, since an active Clang pull request already warns in exactly the cases the proposal would make ill-formed.
- The discussion of alternatives is reasonably developed, including prior approaches and workarounds, though the paper does not fully establish why a library solution is inadequate.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any real argument for why the standard itself must change, or how the change would coordinate with existing implementations and specifications.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): This behavior is a footgun, and is not very useful.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): The proposed change only makes the degenerate form of `std::bit_cast` ill-formed, i.e. it raises an error in code that contained unconditional UB.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 30 passes): The single-function solution is problematic because `std::bit_cast` can be used to convert padded types to a byte array without undefined behavior and with zero overhead.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 30 passes): When bit-casting a type containing padding bits to a type with no padding bits, `std::bit_cast` degenerates into an alternative spelling for `std::unreachable` (some exceptions apply).

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 30 passes): Another case where the degenerate form may arise frequently is bit-casting `_BitInt` (supported by Clang as an extension and proposed in [[P3666R3]](https://wg21%2elink/p3666r3)), considering that most `_BitInt` types (at least 7/8) have padding bits.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): R0 of this paper was more ambitious and presented two approaches:
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): there is an active Clang Pull Request at [https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/200362](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/200362) which adds a `-Wbit-cast-padding` warning which triggers in exactly the same scenarios that this proposal would make ill-formed.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 30 passes): In the discussion of this proposal prior to publication, it was suggested to clear the padding *before* bit-casting. That is, standardizing [`__builtin_clear_padding`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html#index-_005f_005fbuiltin_005fclear_005fpadding) and using an idiom such as:
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 30 passes): Another possible workaround is to use a `struct` containing a `__int128 x:80` bit-field, under the assumption those 80 bits line up with those in `long double`.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): This would likely mean that `constexpr std::clear_padding` is effectively unimplementable in current compilers.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 30 passes): That makes it possible to implement a proper conversion from `long double` to `__int128`, although it requires multiple steps
