Verdict: Adequate to Strong (8/14)

The paper gives a reasonably clear account of why defaulted postfix operators would be useful and why a standard mechanism is preferable to scattered library conventions, but it leaves several practical justifications more asserted than demonstrated. The thinnest support concerns evidence that the feature would actually be adopted, that the interoperability problems are real rather than hypothetical, and that a library solution is genuinely insufficient.

- The strongest support is the paper’s explanation that postfix increment and decrement have a near-universal canonical definition, which makes a standard default a natural fit.
- The paper also establishes that standardizing the default would help shrink library specifications and avoid divergent library-specific implementations.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is adequately grounded, showing that the idea has been considered before and that this proposal is deliberately narrower.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any implementation experience, leaving the practical viability and real-world impact of the feature unsubstantiated.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Postfix increment and decrement operators have a near-universal canonical definition.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): This reduces boilerplate code while still expressing the universally-known meaning of the function.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): There are several existing approaches to attempt a similar reduction in boilerplate. Our position is that none of them quite find the best way to express user intent in code, and will examine them here.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 39 passes): The issue with a rewrite rule is that increment and decrement operators are not as suitable for implicit operations as equality and comparison ones.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): The majority of classes written with postfix operations can now simply default them and get an operator which does the right thing.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 39 passes): Postfix increment and decrement operators have a near-universal canonical definition.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): It is worth noting that there has been a persistent interest in saving user boilerplate when defining operator overloads with canonical definitions, such as speculated on in [P0436].
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): It was intentionally decided not to add a feature test macro for this proposal, as it would have minimal benefit.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): This is a subset of what was proposed in [P1046].
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 39 passes): We do not believe that there is any incompatibility between this paper and P3662.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Standardising a "default" behaviour for postfix operations would also allow us to shrink the library specification, by expressing operations which are specified to be equivalent to the canonical implementation as being default.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): There is also benefit in standardising the way to retrieve this default - multiple libraries might all ship their own `incrementable` or `postfix_increment()` variants, which may make slightly different design choices.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 39 passes): Mixins open the door to potentially confusing semantics, such as my_class being pointer-interconvertible with incrementable
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 39 passes): This approach is opt-out, rather than opt-in, with every copyable and prefix-incrementable class automatically gaining postfix operations whether they make sense or not; and so opens the door to additional surprise features.
