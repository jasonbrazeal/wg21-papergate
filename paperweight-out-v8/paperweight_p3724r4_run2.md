Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper gives a reasonably clear account of the problem and shows that the idea has both prior standardization history and a working implementation, but it leaves several core justifications for standardization largely unargued. The thinnest parts concern why this belongs in the standard rather than in a library, and how it would coordinate with existing or future language and library facilities.

- The strongest support comes from the established prior art, including earlier standardization efforts and a reference implementation.
- The paper also establishes why the feature matters by showing that integer division rounding is a recurring source of user error and that alternative rounding modes have practical uses.
- The claim that a library solution will not do is only asserted, mainly by pointing to common user mistakes, without a developed argument for why standardization is necessary.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established case for why the standard should contain this feature or how it would interoperate with the rest of the language and library.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): C++ currently only offers truncating integer division in the form of the `/` operator.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): There is an *ocean* of examples where C and C++ users have gotten this wrong.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 39 passes): All proposed "top-level rounding modes" have practical applications.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 39 passes): However, other rounding modes have various use cases too, and implementing these as the user can be surprisingly hard, especially when integer overflow needs to be avoided, and negative inputs are accepted.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Such a feature was previously part of [[P0105R1]](https://wg21%2elink/p0105r1) and the Numerics TS [[P1889R1]](https://wg21%2elink/p1889r1), but was eventually abandoned by the author.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): The design somewhat leans on [[P0105R1]](https://wg21%2elink/p0105r1) (which first proposed division functions with custom rounding), but heavily deviates from it.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): A reference implementation can be found on [[GitHub]](https://github%2ecom/Eisenwave/integer-division).
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 39 passes): There is an *ocean* of examples where C and C++ users have gotten this wrong. A few droplets are listed below.
