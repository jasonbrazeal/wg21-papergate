Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers only a thin scaffolding of claims for its own standardization, with every point resting on assertion rather than demonstrated need or evidence. The support is thinnest where the proposal should be most persuasive: it never explains why the standard is the right home for these functions, why a library would not suffice, or how the feature would coordinate with existing interfaces.

- The strongest support is the mention of implementation experience, though even that is only claimed and lacks details about scope, usage, or lessons learned.
- The paper gestures at prior art through P0543R3 but does not establish how that work bears on the current proposal or what alternatives were considered.
- The rationale for affected users and importance is asserted in general terms without showing who specifically needs this or why existing approaches fall short.
- The most glaring omission is the complete absence of any argument for why standardization, rather than a library solution, is necessary.
