Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers a reasonably clear motivation for relaxing the constraints on `std::simd` element types, and it points to prior art and design alternatives in a way that situates the proposal. The support is thinnest around the practical and procedural case: it does not identify who would be affected, explain why a library solution is insufficient, or address coordination and interoperability. The implementation experience is asserted rather than demonstrated in the paper itself.

- The strongest support is the established motivation, which ties the change to type safety, strong typedefs, enumerations, `std::byte`, and avoiding subtle operator-return bugs.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is also established, including the current expression-only checking and the customization-point design in § 7.
- The claim that the standard is the right venue rests mainly on compiler-optimization arguments and implementation anecdotes, but the paper does not establish that case.
- The most glaring omissions are the absence of any identified affected audience, any argument that a library cannot achieve the goal, and any treatment of coordination or interoperability.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 48 passes): This minimal change enables type safety, strong typedefs, enumerations, and `std::byte` while maintaining full backward compatibility.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 48 passes): The C++ standard library includes data-parallel types in the `<simd>` header, currently restricting element types to a closed list: arithmetic types and `std::complex` specializations.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 48 passes): To ensure user-defined types work correctly with `std::simd`, we impose constraints that match hardware capabilities and prevent subtle bugs.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 48 passes): This prevents subtle bugs where user-defined operators return incorrect types.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 48 passes): By relying on compiler optimization, we can open `simd` to user-defined types without requiring customization points for basic operations.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 48 passes): Implementation experience (§ 6 Implementation Experience) demonstrates that with current leading compilers (Clang and Intel oneAPI), these types can generate assembly identical to built-in arithmetic types for standard operations.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 48 passes): By changing only the gate-keeping logic for vectorizable types, we enable type safety for strong typedefs, domain-specific types for signal processing and other specialized domains, enumerations, `std::byte`, and small compound types.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 48 passes): To address these concerns we implemented our proposal in Intel’s `std::simd` implementation and tested it across multiple generations of Intel architectures with various user-defined types, enumerations, strong typedefs, and specialized DSP types (saturating arithmetic and fixed-point).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 48 passes): We implemented this approach in Intel’s `std::simd` implementation and tested across multiple Intel architectures.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 48 passes): Implementation experience demonstrated that element-wise inference produces correct, performant code for most operations.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 48 passes): Implementation experience with leading compilers (Clang 20, Intel oneAPI 2025.0) has shown that they can.
