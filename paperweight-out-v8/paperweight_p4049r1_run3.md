Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers solid support in the areas of motivation, alternatives, and implementation experience, but it leaves several essential parts of the standardization case unaddressed, particularly around why the standard is the right venue and how the change coordinates with existing practice.

- The strongest support is the implementation evidence, which shows current libraries already produce the intended behavior through `memmove` and similar mechanisms.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is well developed, including the C++26 amendment and the relationship to `copy_n` and LWG3089.
- The paper establishes why the change matters by showing the current preconditions provide no optimization benefit and cannot guarantee correct results.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any argument for why the standard itself must change, rather than relying on library-level fixes or existing implementation behavior.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 45 passes): they are incomplete, and they do not enable any useful optimization.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 45 passes): As argued above, the current preconditions offer no optimization benefit and cannot even guarantee a correct result.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 45 passes): We are concerned that *there may be existing code that is accidentally relying on this runtime behavior*; with the proposed change we would be introducing a regression in it.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 45 passes): Having a right overlap today is already undefined behavior; changing e.g. `std::copy` from doing left-to-right assignments to right-to-left assignments in this case is therefore not subject to any form of source compatibility.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 45 passes): SG9 polled E3 for trivially copyable types (the exact wording is in the § 1 Changelog); the result was **SF 2 / F 1 / N 1 / A 2 / SA 0**, that is, no consensus

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 45 passes): Amended by [P3179R8] for C++26 to only take into account the elements that are actually copied.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 45 passes): With this option we would simply drop the *Preconditions* clauses, but we would not be proposing any change to the effects of the algorithms.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 45 passes): For `copy_n`, it establishes new preconditions, matching existing practice and resolving [LWG3089].
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 45 passes): There is little reason for it to differ from `copy`; **we therefore propose to amend `copy_n`’s specification** so that it has the same preconditions and behavior (incl. the conditions for erroneous behavior) as `copy` after this paper.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 45 passes): Existing implementations ([Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/ab6Y1fK3e)) in fact use `memmove` for contiguous ranges of trivially copyable types, which silently produces the *correct* result:
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 45 passes): As mentioned above, right now Standard Library implementations employ `memmove` (or similar) when copying/moving trivially copyable types, and `memmove` already yields the correct result
