Verdict: Strong (9/14)

The paper offers solid grounding in the problem’s practical importance and in prior art, and it demonstrates real implementation experience, but it leaves the central question of why this belongs in the standard essentially unargued. The thinnest support is the absence of any case that a library solution is insufficient or that standardization is the necessary next step.

- The strongest support is the demonstrated existence of multiple working sender implementations and a concrete measurement, showing the problem is real and reproducible.
- The paper also establishes meaningful prior art and alternatives, including direct questions from the community and divergent existing constructions.
- The most glaring omission is the failure to establish why the standard should address this rather than leaving it to libraries or further design exploration.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 54 passes): Both coroutines and senders destroy compound data at an abstraction floor - the difference is that the sender floor sits below the composition algebra, and the coroutine floor is opt-in.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The compound-result pattern is how systems report outcomes when the result carries more than a boolean.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The three-channel model is correct for this class. `std::execution` serves it well.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 54 passes): When a sender keeps `(ec, n)` on the value channel, the programmer has `let_value`. The generic algorithms - `retry`, `when_all`, `upon_error` - do not participate.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 54 passes): Five echo-server implementations - four sender-based constructions and one coroutine-native - implement identical protocol logic.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 54 passes): io_uring delivers `(res, flags)` in one CQE. [6] IOCP delivers `(BOOL, lpNumberOfBytesTransferred, lpOverlapped)` in one call. [7] POSIX `read()` returns `ssize_t` with `errno`. [8] `std::from_chars` returns `{ptr, ec}`.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 54 passes): Krzemieński's question was direct: given a value on the value channel, how do I route it to different channels at runtime?
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The four sender implementations each use a different construction (`variant_sender`, `any_sender_of`, `execution::task`, custom sender), and a programmer encountering the problem for the first time must evaluate all four before choosing.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The generic algorithms - `retry`, `when_all`, `upon_error` - do not participate. They were designed for channel-based dispatch, not value-based dispatch.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 54 passes): [P2300R10](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p2300r10.html) [9] suggests this approach for partial failure (Section 6.3).

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 54 passes): The problem has been identified by Kohlhoff (2021), Kühl (2023), and Shoop (2021). It remains open.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 54 passes): Both mappings demonstrate the same structural problem: any function from `(error_code, size_t)` to `{set_value, set_error, set_stopped}` must either lose data, embed domain-specific classification at the wrong layer, or bypass the channels entirely.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 54 passes): The four sender implementations each use a different construction (`variant_sender`, `any_sender_of`, `execution::task`, custom sender), and a programmer encountering the problem for the first time must evaluate all four before choosing.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 54 passes): The sender constructions require between 2x and 3.5x the line count of the coroutine construction, with the additional lines concentrated in channel-routing and type-erasure machinery.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 54 passes): The generic algorithms do not see the byte count through the channel. They see it through a side channel the programmer constructs.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 54 passes): Petersen constructed four working sender implementations [16] that dispatch compound I/O results onto different channels: one using `exec::variant_sender`, one using `exec::any_sender_of`, one using `std::execution::task`, and one using a custom sender.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 54 passes): [P4090R0](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P4090R0.pdf) [17] provides the concrete measurement.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 54 passes): The author developed and maintains [Capy](https://github.com/cppalliance/capy) [3] and [Corosio](https://github.com/cppalliance/corosio) [4] and believes coroutine-native I/O is a practical foundation for networking in C++.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 54 passes): The compound-result pattern is how systems report outcomes when the result carries more than a boolean.
