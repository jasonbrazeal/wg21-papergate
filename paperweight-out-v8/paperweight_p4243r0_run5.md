Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow justification for changing the specified behavior of `views::zip()`, centered on a claim of mathematical incorrectness. Beyond that motivating assertion, it provides almost no supporting case for standardization, leaving the affected audience, the need for standard action, interoperability concerns, and practical experience entirely unaddressed.

- The paper establishes that the current `views::empty<tuple<>>` result is, in the authors’ view, mathematically incorrect and that they prefer ill-formedness over an infinite range.
- The paper gestures at prior art by citing P2321R2’s explanation that the behavior follows range-v3, but it does not develop this into a comparison of alternatives.
- The paper does not identify who is affected by the current behavior or who would benefit from the change.
- The paper offers no implementation experience, no discussion of why a library-level fix would be insufficient, and no argument for why the standard itself must change.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): This paper proposes a fix that makes the `views::zip()` ill-formed instead of the current `views::empty<tuple<>>`.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 18 passes): The current `views::empty<tuple<>>` is mathematically incorrect.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 18 passes): The authors believe that the correct result of `zip()` is an infinite range `views::repeat(tuple<>())`. However, because infinite ranges sometimes cause confusions to some users, we believe it should be ill-formed. The current `views::empty<tuple<>>` is mathematically incorrect.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 18 passes): The authors believe that the correct result of `zip()` is an infinite range `views::repeat(tuple<>())`. However, because infinite ranges sometimes cause confusions to some users, we believe it should be ill-formed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): According to [[P2321R2]](https://wg21.link/p2321r2), the reason for the current behaviour of `zip()` was: > As in range-v3, zipping nothing produces an `empty_view` of the appropriate type.
