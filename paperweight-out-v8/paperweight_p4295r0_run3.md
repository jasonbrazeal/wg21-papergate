Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers some useful grounding in prior work and a partial implementation, but it does not yet make a persuasive case that this facility belongs in the standard. The thinnest parts are the absence of any identified audience, the lack of a reason the standard must act, and no discussion of why a library solution would be insufficient.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, with a partial implementation available for review.
- The paper also establishes relevant prior art by connecting the proposed single-ended interfaces to earlier concurrent queue proposals.
- The motivation is only asserted in general terms, without showing concretely who needs this and what they cannot do today.
- The most glaring omission is the complete lack of argument for why standardization is necessary rather than leaving this as a library facility.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): So it helps code structure to provide a helper that gives access to only one end of a queue.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Bounded concurrent queues are an important communication mechanism.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): Bounded concurrent queues are an important communication mechanism. But in most cases a specific part in a program only needs acces to one end of the queue.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): This paper proposes two templates that works with any `concurrent_queue` [P0260](https://wg21.link/P0260) that provide only one part of the queue interface.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The single ended interfaces for concurrent queues was in the very first concurrent queue proposal [C++ Concurrent Queues](https://wg21.link/n3353) and was removed by SG1 to make it a separate class.
