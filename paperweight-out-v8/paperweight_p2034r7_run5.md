Verdict: Strong (9/14)

The paper offers solid support in a few important areas, particularly in explaining the problem, showing prior art, and demonstrating implementation experience, but it leaves several essential parts of its standardization case asserted rather than argued. The thinnest support is around who is affected and why the standard, rather than a library solution, is necessary.

- The strongest support is the concrete implementation experience, with a working branch and compiler explorer link showing the feature is feasible.
- The paper also clearly establishes why the issue matters for const-correct callable libraries and logically const lambdas.
- The most glaring omission is that the paper never establishes who is affected by the problem, leaving the scope and urgency of the need unclear.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Taken together, this means the above standard types, and *any* other const-correct callable library, *cannot* work with logically const lambdas in the current form.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Lambdas in such cases require workarounds, such as abandoning logical const correctness, abandoning ownership, or introducing intermediary {non-}const-propagating types.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): There seems to be a commonly shared feeling that there is a simpler language hiding in C++, and that the lambda syntax should be orthogonal to all the other ways of declaring callable types, not a microcosm unto itself.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Capturing by `const` reference is nonetheless useful – for read-only access to an object too large to copy – and today requires `std::cref` or `std::as_const`, which is not as concise, intuitive, or discoverable as `const&`.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The alternative is to simply leave otherwise const captures modifiable, or to use `std::cref`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): P3963 (approved by EWG) restores it for ordinary captures; a const capture then correctly opts back out – exactly as a `const` member of a hand-written callable would.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): P2996 – `nonstatic_data_members_of` enumerates a closure’s captures; `type_of` and `is_mutable_member` report each member’s type and `mutable`-ness
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): `std::move_only_function` (P0288, C++23), and since then `std::copyable_function` (P2548) and `std::function_ref` (P0792) in C++26, improved on `std::function` by respecting the `const` qualifier on their call signature
