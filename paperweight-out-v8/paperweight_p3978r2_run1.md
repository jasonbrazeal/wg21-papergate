Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers some useful support for its case, chiefly by identifying an inconsistency in how `constant_wrapper` behaves across operators and by showing that the proposed behavior has been implemented and tested. However, the argument for standardization remains thin in several important respects, especially around who is affected, why a library solution is insufficient, and how the change would fit with the broader standard.

- The strongest support comes from the paper’s identification of a concrete language inconsistency and its reference to prior related proposals, which gives the discussion a clear starting point.
- The implementation experience is also established, since the author reports shipping the unwrapping overloads in a library and testing them on GCC trunk with libstdc++.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established explanation of who is affected by the current behavior or why the standard, rather than a library, is the right place to address it.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): because of language inconsistencies, std::constant_wrapper is inconsistently not unwrapping for call and subscript operators whereas all other operators can be found via ADL and the conversion operator implemented in constant_wrapper.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The most glaring question on this issue is why would we do this for `operator()` and `operator[]` but for none of the other operators. This seems inconsistent.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): We should reconsider the placement of `constant_wrapper` in `<type_traits>`.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): We should reconsider the placement of `constant_wrapper` in `&lt;type_traits>`.

candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): With this paper, `constant_wrapper` almost achieves parity with what was proposed for `fn_t` / `function_wrapper` by Schultke et al. [P3774R0] and Müller [P3843R2].

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): I always had these unwrapping overloads in my implementation of constant_wrapper shipping in the vir-simd library1 (vir::constexpr_wrapper).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): tested on GCC trunk with libstdc++
