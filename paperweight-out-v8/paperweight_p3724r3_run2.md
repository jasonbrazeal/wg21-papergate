Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers a solid foundation for why integer division with rounding modes is a real and recurring problem, and it demonstrates that the feature has prior standardization history and a working reference implementation. The support is thinnest when it comes to showing why this belongs in the standard rather than in a library, and the paper does not address coordination or interoperability at all.

- The strongest support is the combination of prior art in P0105R1 and the Numerics TS with a complete reference implementation, which shows the design has already been explored and can be built.
- The paper clearly establishes that users frequently get integer division wrong and that the proposed rounding modes correspond to practical needs.
- The case for standardization over a library solution is only asserted, relying on the difficulty of correct user implementations but not showing why a library cannot adequately fill the gap.
- The most glaring omission is the complete absence of any discussion of coordination with existing integer division behavior, other languages, or adjacent standardization efforts.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): C++ currently only offers truncating integer division in the form of the `/` operator.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): There is an *ocean* of examples where C and C++ users have gotten this wrong.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 39 passes): All proposed "top-level rounding modes" have practical applications.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 39 passes): As a rule of thumb, the proposed functionality should be a drop-in replacement for the various bad implementations that users have written themselves (§3.1. Is this not trivial for the user to do?)

candidate 3 (found by 2 of 39 passes): There is an *ocean* of examples where C and C++ users have gotten this wrong. A few droplets are listed below.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 39 passes): The design somewhat leans on [[P0105R1]](https://wg21%2elink/p0105r1) (which first proposed division functions with custom rounding), but heavily deviates from it.
