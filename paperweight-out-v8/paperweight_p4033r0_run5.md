Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers a mixed case for its own standardization: it grounds the motivation and prior-art discussion in concrete failure modes and implementation examples, but it leaves several essential arguments largely asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest support concerns who is actually affected, why the feature belongs in the standard rather than a library, and how it would coordinate with existing or forthcoming reflection facilities.

- The strongest support is the concrete demonstration that index-based switch tables break silently when variants are reordered or extended, while enum-based dispatch remains stable.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is reasonably grounded, particularly in its contrast with the limited generative capabilities of C++26 reflection and its explicit divergence from `define_aggregate`.
- The paper’s claim about who is affected rests almost entirely on the authors’ own implementation experience, which they themselves describe as not extensive.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established argument for why this capability cannot be delivered as a library or why standardization is required.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): If variant<Dog, Tanuki, Cat> is later augmented with variant<Dog, Tanuki, Racoon, Cat>, or the variant are shuffled, the index-based switch table will break silently, not the enum based one.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 24 passes): Synthesizing enumerators of a scoped enum is a fairly simple operation, on the other hand rewiring the proper context for enumerators of an unscoped enum is quite more troublesome and error prone...
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 24 passes): rewiring the proper context for enumerators of an unscoped enum is quite more troublesome and error prone... Also having constants popping out of existing in a fairly large scope could be troublesome

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): The generative capability of reflection as they were introduced in C++26 are limited to `define_aggregate`, with no quick paths to more powerful facilities (See [p3294r2] for example).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Our rationale behind this conservative approach is entirely rooted in our implementation experience (granted not extensive).
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Diverging with the original design of `define_aggregate()`, annotations and attributes are directly supported here via `.annotations` and `.attributes`.
