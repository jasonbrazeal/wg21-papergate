Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper gives a reasonably clear account of why character-type support in `to_chars` and `from_chars` is limited today, and it points to existing implementation practice as evidence that the numeric behavior is already well understood. The support is thinnest around the case for standardization itself: the paper does not identify who is concretely affected, nor does it convincingly show why the work cannot be done outside the standard library.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, since existing ASCII-based `to_chars` and `from_chars` implementations are already numerically doing what the proposal describes.
- The paper also establishes the prior-art situation clearly, including the lack of transcoding facilities and the absence of a usable `charconv` implementation on some EBCDIC platforms.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established audience or user impact, leaving the affected community unspecified.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): `std::to_chars` and `std::from_chars` currently only provide support for `char`, which causes several usability problems.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Due to how common UTF-8 is and due to `char8_t` now regularly being used to represent UTF-8 text in C++ software, the motivation in §2. Introduction mostly refers to `char8_t`.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): The lack of support for `char8_t` (and other character types) severely limits what can be done elsewhere
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The lack of support for `char8_t` (and other character types) severely limits what can be done elsewhere:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The user could use the `std::to_chars(char*, char*, int, int)` overload and then transcode to UTF-8 as `char8_t`, but the standard library provides no transcoding facilities yet.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): It is worth noting that there is a stale proposal [[P2584R0]] "A More Composable `from_chars`" which proposes additional overloads taking `std::span`, superseding the even more stale [[P2007R0]] "`std::from_chars` should work with `std::string_view`".
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): libc++ supports EBCDIC and is used on z/OS (see [https://reviews.llvm.org/D114813](https://reviews.llvm.org/D114813)). Another library with EBCDIC support is the IBM XL C++ for z/OS, but according to [IBM's documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/3.1.0?topic=files-xl-c-header), no `<charconv>` implementation exists yet.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The proposal is a pure extension of the `std::to_chars` and `std::from_chars` overload sets.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 27 passes): In general, `std::to_chars` and `std::from_chars` are important cornerstones upon which other facilities are built, or could be built in the future.
