Verdict: Strong (10/14)

The paper offers real support for the need to standardize its protocol, particularly through its implementation experience and its account of the design space, but the case is uneven: the strongest claims rest on concrete artifacts and prior analysis, while the arguments about who is affected and why the standard is the right home remain asserted rather than demonstrated.

- The paper’s implementation experience is its most solid ground, with a complete protocol and companion facilities available across three platforms.
- The prior art and alternatives are well covered, largely by pointing to a companion paper that supplies the design rationale and evidence framework.
- The thinnest support is around who is affected and why standardization is necessary, where the paper leans on assertions about language-level benefits and a single benchmark row without establishing the breadth or significance of the problem.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): For this to work, something must decide where the coroutine resumes, whether it should stop, and where its frame is allocated.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): The left column is small. The right column is not. Small protocol, big rewards. It earns its keep.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Under type erasure, `connect(sndr, rcvr)` produces a type-dependent `op_state` that must be heap-allocated when either side is erased.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Executor affinity, stop token propagation, frame allocator delivery. Three concerns. One protocol.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): A companion paper, [P4172R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p4172r0.pdf) [1], provides the design rationale, evidence framework, preemptive objections, and analysis of alternative approaches.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary. Each serves the domain where its design choices pay off.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): See [P4172R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p4172r0.pdf) [1] for design rationale and analysis of alternative approaches.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Built on `std::stop_token`.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): In a world with multiple coexisting async models, a coroutine that accidentally `co_await`s across model boundaries should fail at compile time, not silently misbehave at runtime.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 39 passes): Interoperable tasks, awaitables
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 39 passes): A TAPS implementation needs coroutines that suspend, resume correctly, cancel, and allocate frames - exactly what this protocol provides.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 39 passes): The left column is small. The right column is not. Small protocol, big rewards. It earns its keep.
