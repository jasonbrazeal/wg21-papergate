Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow slice of the case for standardization: it clearly identifies a semantic mismatch in the existing name, but it does not establish who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, or how the change would work alongside existing practice. The support is thinnest where a proposal normally needs to be strongest—on the necessity of a standard change rather than a library-level or documentation-level fix.

- The strongest support is the established observation that `std::runtime_format` can now be evaluated at compile time, making its name misleading.
- The paper claims some relevant prior art and terminology alignment, but does not establish that these alternatives were examined or that they support the proposed direction.
- The paper does not establish who is affected by the naming problem, leaving the practical impact of the issue unstated.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any case for why the standard must change, why a library solution would not suffice, or what implementation experience exists.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): As a result, `std::runtime_format` can now be evaluated at compile time, making its name misleading.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 18 passes): The format string is dynamically provided - The format string is not a compile-time constant - The validation is deferred (but may still occur during constant evaluation)
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 18 passes): The term runtime conflates it with evaluation time.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 18 passes): Despite its name, `std::runtime_format` can be evaluated at compile time. This creates a semantic mismatch:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): [P2918] introduced `std::runtime_format` to allow opting out of compile-time format string checks in `std::format`. Subsequently, [P3391] made `std::format` usable in constant evaluation.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 18 passes): The name `std::runtime_format` was accurate when introduced in [P2918], as format strings were not usable in constant evaluation.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 18 passes): This aligns with existing terminology `std::format` such as dynamic format specifiers (`check_dynamic_spec`).
