Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers some grounding for its standardization case, chiefly through prior art and a reference implementation, but it leans heavily on a single repeated rationale for most of the required justifications. The thinnest support is in the areas where the same sentence about users implementing their own deadlock-avoidance algorithm is asked to carry claims about affected users, why the standard is needed, coordination, and why a library will not suffice.

- The strongest support is the existence of a reference implementation, which demonstrates at least some practical engagement with the proposed facility.
- The paper also credibly situates the proposal within the existing C++11 and C++17 locking facilities, establishing relevant prior art.
- The most glaring omission is that the paper does not substantiate why the standard, rather than a library, is the right home for this functionality, beyond asserting that user implementations are error-prone and verbose.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 30 passes): Users who require timeout-based locking of multiple mutexes must implement their own deadlock-avoidance algorithm, typically via `try_lock()`, `unlock()`, and retry. This is error-prone, verbose, and inconsistent with the existing standard library facilities.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): C++11 introduced `std::lock` and `std::try_lock` (and C++17 introduced `std::scoped_lock`) to simplify deadlock-free acquisition of multiple lockables.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Contrary to `std::lock` / `std::try_lock`, the proposed algorithms accept zero or more lockables.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Existing implementations of `std::lock` already use a deadlock-avoidance algorithm.
