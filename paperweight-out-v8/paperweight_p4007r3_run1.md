Verdict: Weak to Adequate (3/14)

The paper offers some grounding in prior art and a concrete implementation report, but it leaves several core parts of the standardization case unargued, particularly who is affected and why a library solution cannot suffice. The strongest material concerns the relationship to `std::execution` and the reported production failure, while the rationale for standardizing this design specifically remains largely asserted rather than demonstrated.

- The paper most clearly establishes that coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` occupy complementary domains and that the proposed design would foreclose environment-based frame allocator propagation without a language change.
- The implementation experience is suggestive but not fully established, resting on a single reported crash whose generality and connection to the proposed design are not developed.
- The paper does not establish who is affected by the problem or why the standard, rather than a library, is the necessary venue for the design.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary. Each serves the domain where its design choices pay off.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): `std::execution::task` ([P3552R3](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3552r3.html) [1]) had open issues identified by national ballot comments, LWG issues, and published papers.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Of these, Croydon resolved six: Unusual Allocator Customisation, Flexible Allocator Position, and Shadowing The Environment Allocator were addressed by P3980R1 [6]
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Shipping standardizes the two-tier split. A design where frame allocation participates in environment-based propagation is foreclosed without a language change to coroutine allocation.
