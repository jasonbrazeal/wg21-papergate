Verdict: Adequate to Strong (8/14)

The paper offers solid grounding for the problem’s importance and for the existence of usable prior art and implementation experience, but it does not convincingly show who is affected, why the feature belongs in the standard rather than a library, or how it would coordinate with existing practice. The thinnest parts are the absence of any interoperability discussion and the reliance on general claims about user error rather than demonstrated need for standardization.

- The strongest support is the established prior art and reference implementation, which show the design is feasible and has a history in the committee’s own work.
- The paper also clearly establishes why integer division rounding modes matter and that implementing them correctly is nontrivial.
- A notable weakness is that the affected audience is only asserted through a search result and a broad claim, without concrete evidence of widespread or representative impact.
- The most glaring omission is the complete lack of coordination and interoperability discussion, leaving the relationship to existing integer division behavior and related facilities unexamined.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): C++ currently only offers truncating integer division in the form of the `/` operator.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): There is an *ocean* of examples where C and C++ users have gotten this wrong.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): All proposed "top-level rounding modes" have practical applications.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 39 passes): However, other rounding modes have various use cases too, and implementing these as the user can be surprisingly hard, especially when integer overflow needs to be avoided, and negative inputs are accepted.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Such a feature was previously part of [[P0105R1]](https://wg21%2elink/p0105r1) and the Numerics TS [[P1889R1]](https://wg21%2elink/p1889r1), but was eventually abandoned by the author.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): The design somewhat leans on [[P0105R1]](https://wg21%2elink/p0105r1) (which first proposed division functions with custom rounding), but heavily deviates from it.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): A reference implementation can be found on [[GitHub]](https://github%2ecom/Eisenwave/integer-division).
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 39 passes): See [[GitHub]](https://github%2ecom/Eisenwave/integer-division) for the full implementation.
