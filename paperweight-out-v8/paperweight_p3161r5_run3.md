Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers a solid opening case for why the problem matters and shows meaningful engagement with prior art, but it leaves much of the practical argument for standardization asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest support appears around implementation experience and the claim that a library solution cannot suffice, where the reasoning is suggestive but not backed by evidence.

- The strongest support is the paper’s explanation of why the functionality is needed, including the difficulty of expressing it efficiently in portable C++ and the inadequacy of saturation alone.
- The treatment of prior art is also well grounded, pointing to accepted work like P0543 and existing division functions to situate the proposal.
- The case for why this belongs in the standard rather than a library is only claimed, relying on general statements about compiler-specific code without showing that a portable library is actually impractical.
- The most glaring omission is implementation experience, where a reference implementation is mentioned but no evidence is offered that it has been used, tested, or adopted in real code.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 54 passes): It's rather cumbersome and error prone to implement similar functionality using only C++, resulting in extremely inefficient code for what could often be a couple or even a single line of assembly.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 54 passes): I lament the fact that C++ doesn't have a better syntax and support features for multiple return values.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 54 passes): Some may object to the naming of sub_borrow as opposed to sub_carry, as this may be seen as "an endorsement of intel's naming convention".
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The whole point of these functions is because we want to do arithmetic with numbers that cannot be represented by the standard types, but whose exact bitwise content is relevant and useful.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The paper [P0543], has already been accepted and is on track for C++26, however "saturation" is just a narrow type of overflow behavior, which is insufficient to implement things like multi-word integers.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 54 passes): Saturation - Value saturates on overflow, as adopted by paper [P0543]
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 54 passes): Functions such as the trivial division (/), std::div, and std::div_sat already expects the user to check and avoid calling the function if it would trigger undefined behavior.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The [analysis paper] and [P3018R0] suggests the addition of "add_overflow", "sub_overflow", "mul_overflow", and "div_overflow", and yet they are not part of this paper.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 54 passes): If I have to create my own facility, and that is what actually gets used in replacement of the standard, then why not make that the standard?
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 54 passes): The reference also illustrates the difficulty of implementing these features effectively using only standard C++, and in order to be efficient it relies heavily on compiler specific features and even inline assembly with instructions specific to a particular CPU.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 54 passes): A developer trying to deliver these features as a portable third-party library would be faced with the monumental task of having to tailor code specifically for every permutation of compiler and CPU that the library aimed to support.
