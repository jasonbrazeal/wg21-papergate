Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper’s strongest support lies in its explanation of why the current template template parameter deduction rules create a real core-language problem, and it credibly points to existing practice and prior standardization work as a foundation. The case becomes thinner around the affected audience, the necessity of a core-language change, and the absence of direct implementation experience with the proposed semantics.

- The paper establishes why the issue matters by tying it to specific core and library issues and showing that current deduction can produce types that cannot be written through the template template parameter.
- The paper establishes prior art and alternatives by referencing P0552R0 and the existing CTAD-for-alias-template semantics as the model for the proposed behavior.
- The paper claims but does not establish that the library cannot be fixed without core-language changes, since it relies on the assertion of “no known fix” without demonstrating that alternatives have been exhausted.
- The paper’s thinnest support is implementation experience, because it admits no implementation yet matches the exact proposed semantics and offers only informal claims about current acceptance of simpler cases.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This means that default template arguments specified on the template template parameters are ignored during deduction and that types can be deduced that can’t otherwise be written using the name of the template template parameter.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 33 passes): addressing both CWG 3003 and LWG 4381.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): There is no known fix for the library wording without changes to the core language, see LWG 4381 "std::ranges::to specification using CTAD not supported by core language".
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 33 passes): This currently crashes most implementations, but as the *defining-type-id* of Alias doesn’t denote a deducible template, it should just be ill-formed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): But since [P0552R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0522r0.html) "DR: Matching of template template-arguments excludes compatible templates", a template template argument doesn’t have to match a template template parameter exactly; the template template parameter just needs to be more specialized than the template template argument.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Current implementations accept the above examples (except for the last one) with the "simple substitution" semantics.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): This is consistent with how CTAD for alias templates works, and the proposal is to use those semantics instead of directly substituting the template template argument.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 33 passes): addressing both CWG 3003 and LWG 4381.
