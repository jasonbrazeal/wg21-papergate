Verdict: Strong to Excellent (10/14)

The paper offers substantial evidence that a null-terminated string view type is widely used, independently implemented, and wanted for C and OS interoperability, but its case for why this must be standardized rather than left to libraries is asserted more than demonstrated. The strongest material concerns real-world implementation experience and prior art, while the thinnest concerns the unique role of the standard library in solving the problem.

- The paper convincingly shows broad, active implementation and use of cstring_view and zstring_view across major and minor projects, including independent work by NVIDIA.
- It establishes meaningful prior art and coordination needs through the earlier P1402 attempt, the adjoint P3862 paper, and the type’s role in C API interaction.
- It does not adequately establish why a standard library type is necessary when so many existing library implementations already fill the need.
- The claim that the type is a “lingua franca” and therefore belongs in the standard is asserted without showing what breaks or remains fragmented in its absence.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): We propose a standard string view type that guarantees null-termination.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Many functions right now whether C++ standard library calls, operating system calls, or third-party library calls require null-terminated C-style strings.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The use case of having a null-terminated string is much more common, in particular in interaction with C APIs (such as OS APIs, things like the Yubico libfido2 library, libsqlite and others).
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 27 passes): As such, we do believe that there is both space for such a type, and a desire from multiple angles to have it defined in the standard library.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Its wide presence on Github with implementations from among others Microsoft, Google, and many smaller projects, indicates a wide support for the type.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Since the first draft of this paper the use of cstring_view and zstring_view on Github has grown from 1.9k to 2.1k, indicating active use, and in many cases people adding new implementations of the type.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Github code search shows similar popularity between [`cstring_view`](https://github.com/search?q=%2F%5Cbcstring_view%5Cb%2F%20language%3Ac%2B%2B%20-is%3Afork&type=code) (1.2k results as of the time of writing) and [`zstring_view`](https://github.com/search?q=%2F%5Cbzstring_view%5Cb%2F+language%3Ac%2B%2B+-is%3Afork&type=code) (680 results as of the time of writing).
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): This is one of the commonly-requested features from the GSL library that does not yet have a std:: equivalent.

candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): An attempt was made in Feb 2019 to concretely propose the type (renamed to cstring_view) with P1402, but it failed to gain consensus in LEWGI at Kona.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): There is an adjoint paper (P3862) that proposes to fix this in the existing-but-unpublished C++26 standard to avoid future deviation in having std::string::subview return string_view for subview(n).
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 27 passes): NVIDIA implemented cstring_view independently, with almost identical features.
