Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper gives a partial account of why range-based searchers would be useful, but it leaves several core justifications for standardization largely unargued. The strongest material concerns prior art and implementation experience, while the thinnest concerns the affected audience, interoperability, and why a library solution would not suffice.

- The paper’s implementation experience is concrete, with a working implementation available in the Beman Project.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is substantive, including consideration of reusing existing searchers and the algorithmic basis for Boyer-Moore.
- The paper asserts that the current API is unsuitable for Ranges and that users are forced out of the Ranges world, but it does not establish who is affected or how widespread the problem is.
- The paper does not address coordination with other library components, interoperability concerns, or why this cannot be delivered as a library rather than a standard feature.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): It was originally introduced for more performant specialized searching.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Current inconsistency in the `std::ranges::search` API forces users to exit the Ranges world to use searchers and resort to using traditional STL algorithms instead, which is undesirable.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): There are several peculiarities in this API that make it unsuitable for the Ranges library, thus prompting this proposal to propose new `std::ranges` versions of the standard searchers

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): A possible less invasive change is to reuse the existing searchers, but only update `std::ranges::search` with the new overloads.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The implementation basically copies libc++'s searcher implementation and modify them to accommodate the new API.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): This proposal introduces `std::ranges` versions of the `Searcher` overload of the `std::search` algorithm, which takes a searcher object instead of an iterator pair and (optionally) a predicate.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): the standard `boyer_moore_searcher` implements the [Boyer-Moore String Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string-search_algorithm), which can achieve a worst-case running time of `O(N + S)` instead (requires some variation on the original 1977 version of the algorithm).

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The author thinks that requiring the user to write `ranges::search(haystack, boyer_moore_searcher(needle.begin(), needle.end()))` is strictly worse than introducing Range-ified versions of the searchers.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The Ranges library introduced `std::ranges::subrange` directly for this purpose, and thus, that should be used as the return type instead.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): There are several peculiarities in this API that make it unsuitable for the Ranges library, thus prompting this proposal to propose new `std::ranges` versions of the standard searchers
