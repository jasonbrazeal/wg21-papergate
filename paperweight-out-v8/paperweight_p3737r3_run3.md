Verdict: Strong (10/14)

The paper offers solid support in the areas that matter most for a narrow, implementation-focused change: it demonstrates real divergence, identifies existing conforming practice, and shows that the proposed behavior is already deployed in major libraries. The case is thinnest where it needs to explain why a library-level solution cannot suffice and why the affected audience extends beyond the two standard libraries already in compliance.

- The strongest support comes from concrete implementation experience, with a table showing how major standard libraries handle zero-length `std::array` and confirmation that libstdc++ and libc++ already match the proposal.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives clearly, framing the proposal as standardizing the greatest common denominator of existing practice and noting the MSVC STL’s nonconformance and ABI constraints.
- The argument for why the standard must act is asserted rather than demonstrated, relying on general claims about WG21’s habits rather than evidence specific to this change.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any case for why a library will not do, leaving unaddressed whether users could obtain these guarantees through a non-standard facility or wrapper.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): However, its specification in the standard is considerably more permissive and should be simplified.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): A stricter specification would provide additional useful guarantees such as `std::array<T, N>` being trivially copyable when `T` is trivially copyable.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The zero-length case is also where we see some implementation divergence in size and alignment of the array.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The `std::array` class template has established itself as a de-facto replacement for "builtin arrays" or "C-style arrays" in many code bases.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The MSVC STL implements zero-length `std::array`s incorrectly and does not comply with C++26 (or any prior standard), and fixing this would require an ABI break.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): It seems like the vagueness in the specification serves no practical purpose; it is unclear what implementations could do with the additional freedom, other than pranking their users.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The "greatest common denominator" between these implementations (excluding MSVC STL) should be standardized, which is:

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 27 passes): it would be unusual for WG21 to shy away from standardizing universally existing practice and to recommend users to rely on non-standard implementation details, simply because those implementation details are widespread.
