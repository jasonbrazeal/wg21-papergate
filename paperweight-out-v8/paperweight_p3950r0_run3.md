Verdict: Adequate (7/14)

The paper offers a solid conceptual case for removing the restriction, grounded in a clear statement of the problem and relevant prior work, but it leaves several practical dimensions of the standardization case largely unaddressed. The support is thinnest around who is concretely affected, how the change interacts with the broader ecosystem, and whether the proposed implementation has been validated beyond the author’s own experience.

- The strongest support is the established rationale that the current ban is arbitrary and creates an unnecessary special case for `void`, with direct consequences for `std::execution` interoperability.
- The paper also credibly establishes prior art and alternatives by citing an earlier proposal and explaining why existing library workarounds are unsatisfactory.
- The claim that only a compiler change can address the restriction is plausible but not established, since the paper does not demonstrate that no library-level technique could approximate the desired behavior.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established evidence about who is affected, how implementations or adjacent features would coordinate, or whether the author’s implementation experience has been reproduced or reviewed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Disallowing `return_void` alongside `return_value` is fundamentally arbitrary, unnecessarily making `void` a special case.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 24 passes): Unfortunately the standard bans this by fiat (§9.6.4 [dcl.fct.def.coroutine]): *“If searches for the names* `return_void` *and* `return_value` *in the scope of the promise type* *each find any declarations, the program is ill-formed.”*
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 24 passes): Trying to accept `std::execution::set_value_t()` (i.e. successful completion with no values) alongside any other `std::execution::set_value_t(...)` form, on the other hand, does not work. Not for any conceptual reason, but simply because the standard bans it by fiat.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 24 passes): This restriction has been present in its current form since N4499 ([1] at §6.6.4):

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): There has previously been a paper by a different author with the same goal as this paper [4]. It had no consensus in Cologne in 2019, however the author of this paper feels there is new information [5][6].
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): `std::execution`, which will ship in C++26, provides “the [library] implementation of an `async-function`” ([8] at §6).
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Disallowing it either disadvantages coroutines vis-à-vis `std::execution` or necessitates library workarounds (e.g. the tag type approach discussed in the preceding section).

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): This restriction can only be implemented by the compiler. Regular C++ code cannot check for “names” or “declarations,” it can only check for well-formed expressions.
