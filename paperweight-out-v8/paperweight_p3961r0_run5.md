Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers a partial case for its own standardization, with its strongest material concentrated in motivation, prior art, and a concrete implementation, while the broader evidentiary requirements remain largely unaddressed. The thinnest areas concern who would be affected, why the change belongs in the standard rather than in a library, and how it would coordinate with existing specifications.

- The paper establishes why the change matters by tying it to a specific LWG issue and showing a concrete compile-time failure that the proposal would resolve.
- It credibly grounds the design in prior art and alternatives, particularly the parallel with `noexcept` function types and the discussion of `reference_wrapper` unwrapping.
- The existence of an implementation gives the proposal some practical weight, though it does not by itself demonstrate real-world usage or demand.
- The most glaring omission is any account of who is affected, leaving the proposal without evidence of user impact, codebase prevalence, or ecosystem need.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): RU-220 calls for allowing skipping indirections when constructing `function_ref` to improve codegen.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Without this paper, `r1 = r2` doesn't compile.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 24 passes): The users shouldn't expect `function_ref` to exhibit a "reference to reference" behavior.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Closely matching the behavior of `noexcept` function types in the core language
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): because unwrapping `reference_wrapper` is a discussed matter about 8 years ago, the author wants to see more evidence in real-world code to justify this change.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 24 passes): This paper (P3961) suggests that, in addition to the change, a subset of the "optimized" cases should be mandated.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 24 passes): The proposed change in LWG 4264<sup>[1]</sup> is not strictly an optimization because certain behaviors with and without the change are visible, therefore, need to be made unspecified.
