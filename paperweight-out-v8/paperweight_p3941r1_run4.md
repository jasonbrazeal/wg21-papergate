Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers some grounding for its motivation and for the design change it wants to make, but it leaves most of the case for standardization unstated. The strongest material concerns why the current specification was problematic and what alternative shape the facility should take; the thinnest areas are the absence of any identified audience, any argument that this belongs in the standard rather than a library, and any real implementation evidence.

- The paper establishes why the change matters by connecting it to concerns raised against `affine_on` in P3796R1 and to the earlier `continues_on` design for `task`.
- It establishes some prior art and alternative thinking by explaining that the revised guarantee allows `affine_on` to take only the sender for the work.
- The claim of implementation experience is not established, since the paper only gestures at one existing library and says the form was recommended against.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any established case for who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, or why a library solution would not suffice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): There were multiple concerns raised against the specification of `affine_on` and discussed as part of [P3796R1](https://wg21.link/P3796R1).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The discussion on `affine_on` revealed some aspects which were not quite clear previously and taking these into account points towards a better design than was previously specified:
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 15 passes): Changing the scheduler affects the coroutine until the end of the coroutine or until `change_coroutine_scheduler` is `co_await`ed again. It doesn’t automatically reset.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 15 passes): The original proposal for `task` used `continues_on` to schedule the work back on the original scheduler.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): There were multiple concerns raised against the specification of `affine_on` and discussed as part of [P3796R1](https://wg21.link/P3796R1).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): with this guarantee in place, `affine_on` only needs one parameter, i.e., the sender for the work to be executed.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The original proposal for `task` used `continues_on` to schedule the work back on the original scheduler.
