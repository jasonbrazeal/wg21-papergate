Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a narrow, internal rationale for renaming `std::execution::affine_on`, and it does not build a broader case for why that change belongs in the standard. The support is thinnest around the absence of affected users, implementation experience, and any explanation of why a library-level solution would be insufficient.

- The strongest support is the paper’s observation that the current unary shape of `affine_on` makes the “on” in its name semantically misleading.
- The paper gestures at prior art by recounting the algorithm’s binary origin and the later redesign, but it does not establish how that history supports standardization of a rename.
- The paper does not identify who would be affected by the change or what practical problem the current name causes for users.
- Most glaringly, the paper offers no implementation experience, no interoperability considerations, and no argument for why the standard, rather than a library or guidance document, is the right vehicle for the change.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Rendering `std::execution::affine_on` unary [2] destroys the rationale for including “on” in the name thereof.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 27 passes): changing the shape of the interface warranted changing the name of the algorithm
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): Remove “on” from the name of `std::execution::affine_on` as it no longer makes sense.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Before the addition of `std::execution::task` [1] the `std::execution` namespace contained three entities whose name was intended to contain the ordinary English word “on:”
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 27 passes): Later [2] it was redesigned to be unary accepting only a sender (the first bullet from above).
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): During LEWG discussion of the above (2026-03-24 in Croydon) it was mentioned (by the author of this paper) that changing the shape of the interface warranted changing the name of the algorithm
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): When `std::execution::affine_on` was added [1] it was a binary-invocable object accepting two parameters
