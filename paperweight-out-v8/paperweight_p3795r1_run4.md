Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow basis for its own standardization, chiefly by identifying prior art and the incidental relationship to an existing reflection facility. Its broader case remains thin: the motivation is asserted rather than demonstrated, and there is little evidence about who would benefit, why a library solution is insufficient, or how the feature would fit with existing practice.

- The strongest support comes from the recognition that related facilities already exist and that the proposed information is currently available only indirectly through `std::meta::access_context`.
- The paper claims the feature is useful and occasionally requested, but does not establish that usefulness with concrete use cases or affected users.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any implementation experience or evidence that the proposed interface has been tried in practice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): Given that this is a useful (and occasionally asked for) piece of information, we should just provide it directly, rather than having this API proliferate.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 18 passes): Because these were all (somewhat) independent papers that were adopted at the same time, there were a few inconsistencies that were introduced.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 18 passes): there were a few inconsistencies that were introduced. Some gaps in coverage. Some inconsistent APIs.

candidate 2 (found by 3 of 18 passes): [[P2996R13]](https://wg21.link/p2996r13)’s mechanism for access checking relies on `std::meta::access_context`. However, that facility exposes another interesting bit of functionality — albeit in a very indirect way.
