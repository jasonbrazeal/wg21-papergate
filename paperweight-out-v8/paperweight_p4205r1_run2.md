Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers some grounding for its proposal through implementation experience and a clear account of the existing API’s relationship to prior art, but it leaves the central rationale largely asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest support concerns who would benefit, why a library solution is insufficient, and how the proposed additions would coordinate with existing practice.

- The strongest support is the existence of a working implementation in the Beman Project, which shows the proposed API is at least feasible.
- The paper also credibly establishes prior art by explaining how the existing searcher API is unsuitable for Ranges and by pointing to analogous adaptations like `std::ranges::less`.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any identified user population or concrete use case showing who is affected by the current inconsistency.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): It was originally introduced for more performant specialized searching.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Current inconsistency in the `std::ranges::search` API forces users to exit the Ranges world to use searchers and resort to using traditional STL algorithms instead, which is undesirable.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): There are several peculiarities in this API that make it unsuitable for the Ranges library, thus prompting this proposal to propose new `std::ranges` versions of the standard searchers

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): There are several peculiarities in this API that make it unsuitable for the Ranges library, thus prompting this proposal to propose new `std::ranges` versions of the standard searchers, similarly to the relation between `std::ranges::less` and `std::less<T>`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): The implementation basically copies libc++'s searcher implementation and modify them to accommodate the new API.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): This proposal introduces `std::ranges` versions of the `Searcher` overload of the `std::search` algorithm, which takes a searcher object instead of an iterator pair and (optionally) a predicate.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 33 passes): the standard `boyer_moore_searcher` implements the [Boyer-Moore String Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string-search_algorithm), which can achieve a worst-case running time of `O(N + S)` instead (requires some variation on the original 1977 version of the algorithm).

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Current inconsistency in the `std::ranges::search` API forces users to exit the Ranges world to use searchers and resort to using traditional STL algorithms instead, which is undesirable.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): The author thinks that requiring the user to write `ranges::search(haystack, boyer_moore_searcher(needle.begin(), needle.end()))` is strictly worse than introducing Range-ified versions of the searchers.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 33 passes): the `Searcher` overload is never included in either Boost.Ranges or range-v3, and as a result, the current Ranges library never included a `std::ranges::search` overload with `Searcher` arguments.
