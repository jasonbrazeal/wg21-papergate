Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a thin, largely rhetorical case for its own standardization, with most of its energy spent on naming preferences rather than on demonstrating a need that the standard can uniquely address. The support is thinnest where it matters most: there is no argument for why this belongs in the standard, why a library cannot solve the problem, or how the feature would coordinate with existing or planned facilities.

- The strongest support is the paper’s engagement with prior naming discussions and its acknowledgment that the current `system_context_replaceability` name is confusing because `system_context` does not exist in the working draft.
- The paper gestures at affected parties by citing a Kona poll, but it does not establish who would actually be affected or how.
- The discussion of alternatives is limited to renaming options and does not establish that any of them has been seriously evaluated against the proposed direction.
- The most glaring omission is the complete absence of any case for why standardization is necessary at all, including no implementation experience, no interoperability analysis, and no explanation of why a library would be insufficient.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): Adding `system_context_replaceability` namespace name to C++26 will cause a lot of confusion because `system_context` does not even exist in the current working draft.

  [5] 3 References                                 0/0/0  -> 0.00
candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): [[P3804R1]](https://wg21.link/p3804r1) proposed several options favoring `replacement` and `replacement_functions`. As people pointed out, those names are probably also not great because they don’t give any sense of what developers try to replace.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 15 passes): Option 1: Change `std::execution::system_context_replaceability` namespace name to `std::execution::parallel_scheduler_replaceability`.
