Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a narrow, name-focused rationale for its proposal, and even that rests on claims about discussion context rather than demonstrated need. The support is thinnest around the practical case for standardization: there is no evidence about who would be affected, what alternatives were seriously weighed, why a library solution would be insufficient, or whether anyone has implemented the change.

- The strongest support is the paper’s observation that making `affine_on` unary undermines the original naming rationale, which is credited as a claim about why the change matters.
- The paper also gestures at prior discussion where the author reportedly said a shape change warranted a name change, though this remains asserted rather than documented as a considered alternative.
- The most glaring omission is the complete absence of any account of who is affected by the proposed change or what practical problem it solves for users.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Rendering `std::execution::affine_on` unary [2] destroys the rationale for including “on” in the name thereof.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): changing the shape of the interface warranted changing the name of the algorithm
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): it was mentioned (by the author of this paper) that changing the shape of the interface warranted changing the name of the algorithm

candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): During LEWG discussion of the above (2026-03-24 in Croydon) it was mentioned (by the author of this paper) that changing the shape of the interface warranted changing the name of the algorithm
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): Later [2] it was redesigned to be unary accepting only a sender (the first bullet from above).
