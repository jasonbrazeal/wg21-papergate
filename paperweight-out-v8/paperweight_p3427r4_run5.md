Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper gives a reasonably concrete account of the performance motivation and the existence of production use, but it leaves several parts of the standardization case asserted rather than demonstrated, especially around why this belongs in the standard and why a library solution would not suffice.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, with Folly’s `hazptr_obj_cohort` in production use since 2018.
- The paper also establishes the prior art and alternative approach clearly, including a comparison with the existing hazard pointer interface.
- The case for why the standard should adopt this is thin, resting mainly on a recommendation and a general claim about usability.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of an established argument for why a library implementation will not do, since the paper’s own evidence points to an existing library solution.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This paper proposes supporting object cohorts due to the importance of synchronous reclamation for general purpose usability.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Object cohorts have been part of the Folly open-source library (under the name `hazptr_obj_cohort`) and in heavy use in production since 2018.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): While its guarantees are weaker and less flexible than global cleanup, its efficiency enables users to use it in performance sensitive cases where the cost of global cleanup may be impractical.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Doing so avoids burdening the current thread with potentially performing amortized reclamation of tens of thousands of possibly unrelated retired objects, because calling `retire` may trigger amortized asynchronous reclamation.

candidate 2 (found by 2 of 36 passes): It strikes a better balance between practicality and performance.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 36 passes): For example, a concurrent hash map that uses hazard pointers is more generally usable if it allows arbitrary key and value types rather than only types without dependence on resources with independent lifetimes.

candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): An alternative approach is the use of object cohorts, which are sets of protectable objects.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The following table shows two code snippets one using the P2530R3 C++26 hazard pointer interface and one using object cohorts, respectively.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Therefore a free function hazard_pointer_try_reclamation() is added, so that users can write the cohort equivalent to the above non-cohort code snippet as follows:
