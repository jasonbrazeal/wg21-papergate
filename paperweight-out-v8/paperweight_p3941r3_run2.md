Verdict: Weak to Adequate (3/14)

The paper offers only partial support for its own standardization, with the strongest material concentrated in its discussion of prior art and alternatives. The case is thinnest around the basic motivating questions: why the problem matters, who is affected, and why a library solution or the standard itself is the right vehicle.

- The paper does establish that it is responding to prior discussion and discontinued work, and that its wording is situated relative to existing proposals.
- The paper claims, but does not establish, why the change matters, pointing to concerns raised about `affine_on` without showing the significance of those concerns.
- The paper does not identify who is affected by the problem or what real-world code would benefit.
- The paper leaves unaddressed why the standard should solve this rather than a library, and offers no implementation experience to ground the proposal.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): There were multiple concerns raised against the specification of `affine_on` and discussed as part of [P3796R1](https://wg21.link/P3796R1).
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 15 passes): The discussion on `affine_on` revealed some aspects which were not quite clear previously and taking these into account points towards a better design than was previously specified:

candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): [P3718R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3718r0.html) is, however, discontinued (for unrelated reasons) and adding the guarantee to get the current scheduler from a receiver query is proposed here.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The original proposal for `task` used `continues_on` to schedule the work back on the original scheduler.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 15 passes): [ Editor's note: This wording is relative to [N5032](https://wg21.link/N5032) with the changes from [P3826r3](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p3826r3.html) applied. ]
