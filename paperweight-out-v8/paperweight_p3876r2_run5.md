Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper offers some concrete support for its standardization case, particularly around motivation, prior art, and implementation experience, but it leaves several essential questions largely unargued. The thinnest areas are the absence of any identified user population and the unsubstantiated claims about why this work belongs in the standard rather than in a library.

- The strongest support is the established implementation experience, since existing ASCII-based `to_chars` and `from_chars` implementations already do numerically what the proposal asks for.
- The paper also credibly establishes prior art and alternatives by pointing to stale related proposals and the lack of standard transcoding facilities.
- The most glaring omission is that the paper never establishes who is affected by the current lack of `char8_t` support, leaving the audience for the proposed change unspecified.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): `std::to_chars` and `std::from_chars` currently only provide support for `char`, which causes several usability problems.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Due to how common UTF-8 is and due to `char8_t` now regularly being used to represent UTF-8 text in C++ software, the motivation in §2. Introduction mostly refers to `char8_t`.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): File formats such as JSON require the use of Unicode character encodings, so an application that deals with JSON may want to use `char8_t` in its APIs and internally.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The lack of support for `char8_t` (and other character types) severely limits what can be done elsewhere

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): It is worth noting that there is a stale proposal [[P2584R0]](https://wg21%2elink/p2584r0) "A More Composable `from_chars`" which proposes additional overloads taking `std::span`, superseding the even more stale [[P2007R0]](https://wg21%2elink/p2007r0) "`std::from_chars` should work with `std::string_view`".
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): The user could use the `std::to_chars(char*, char*, int, int)` overload and then transcode to UTF-8 as `char8_t`, but the standard library provides no transcoding facilities yet.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): The proposal is a pure extension of the `std::to_chars` and `std::from_chars` overload sets.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 27 passes): libc++ supports EBCDIC and is used on z/OS (see [https://reviews.llvm.org/D114813](https://reviews.llvm.org/D114813)). Another library with EBCDIC support is the IBM XL C++ for z/OS, but according to [IBM's documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/3.1.0?topic=files-xl-c-header), no `<charconv>` implementation exists yet.

candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): In general, `std::to_chars` and `std::from_chars` are important cornerstones upon which other facilities are built, or could be built in the future.
