Verdict: Adequate (7/14)

The paper offers a solid foundation in some areas, particularly in demonstrating that the problem is real and that implementers have already explored the proposed direction, but it leaves several essential parts of the standardization case largely unaddressed. The thinnest support concerns the core question of why a standard change is needed at all, since the paper does not establish that the current behavior is defective in a way the standard must fix, nor does it show why a library solution would be insufficient or how the change would interact with existing practice.

- The strongest support comes from implementation experience, where the proposed wording has been implemented in Clang forks and used to compile large real-world codebases, with concrete divergences documented.
- The paper also clearly establishes why the issue matters by identifying implausible declarations and explaining how they make C++ harder to understand.
- Prior art and alternatives are adequately covered through references to related proposals and the author’s implementation work.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established case for why the standard itself must change, leaving the central justification for standardization unsupported.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): This permits implausible declarations like `A& operator=(const A&) && = default`, where the left-hand operand is rvalue-ref-qualified.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The possibility of these unrealistic declarations makes C++ harder to understand.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): We have also searched for any real-world use of these operator overloads to assess deployment.
