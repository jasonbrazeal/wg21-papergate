Verdict: Strong (9/14)

The paper offers solid support in the areas of motivation, prior art, and implementation experience, but its case is much thinner when it comes to showing who is affected, why a standard change is required, and how the change would coordinate with existing specifications. The most glaring absence is any discussion of why a library-only solution would be insufficient.

- The strongest support is the demonstrated implementation experience, with GCC 15 already matching the proposed behavior and the paper using compiler divergence to identify what implementations treat as constant.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives clearly by citing CWG issues and SG6 guidance that the proposal would align with.
- The weakest established area is why the standard must change, since the paper only asserts that core and library divergence is unmotivated without showing a concrete need for normative action.
- The most glaring omission is the complete lack of any argument for why a library-only approach cannot address the problem.

candidate 1 (found by 6 of 27 passes): The current specification of floating-point overflow is unclear.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Existing code that relied on `max() * 2` being a constant expression will fail to compile.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): There is little motivation to have the core language and the library diverge in this area. At best, a user's compile-time floating-point computations would overflow and turn into infinity, but is that a useful outcome for constant evaluation? Likely not.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): There is little motivation to have the core language and the library diverge in this area.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): GCC 15 implements the proposed behavior exactly. Clang and MSVC compilers deviate only slightly.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): It is also worth noting that on [[CWG2168]](https://cplusplus%2egithub%2eio/CWG/issues/2168%2ehtml), SG6 gave some guidance:
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): This approach is consistent with the design of mathematical functions; for example, `exp(1'000'000)` results in a range error, meaning that infinity is returned and the expression is not constant.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): [[CWG2723]](https://cplusplus%2egithub%2eio/CWG/issues/2723%2ehtml) added a definition of "range of representable values" without discussing [[CWG2168]](https://cplusplus%2egithub%2eio/CWG/issues/2168%2ehtml) or consulting SG6, and the resolution of [[CWG2723]](https://cplusplus%2egithub%2eio/CWG/issues/2723%2ehtml) directly contradicts the SG6 guidance

candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): As can be seen in §2.3. Implementation divergence, GCC 15 considers an expression to be constant if and only if no floating-point exception is raised (ignoring `FE_INEXACT` and `FE_UNDERFLOW`), making GCC 15 relatively consistent with `<cmath>` already.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): GCC 15 implements the proposed behavior exactly.
