Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers solid grounding for the need to bring C23 math features into C++, particularly through its discussion of prior art, existing implementations, and the value-representation problem with by-value classification functions. The support thins considerably around who is affected, why a library cannot solve the problem, and whether the standard is the right venue, leaving several parts of the standardization case asserted rather than demonstrated.

- The strongest support comes from the paper’s identification of a concrete language-level defect in how prvalues discard value representations, which motivates standardizing a fix rather than relying on user code.
- The prior art and alternatives section is well supported by references to P3348R4, ISO/IEC 60559, C23, and existing gnulibc implementations.
- The case for why the standard is necessary is weakened by relying on general statements about useful C23 features without showing a specific need that only standardization can meet.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any discussion of who is affected or why a library solution would be insufficient, leaving the proposal’s audience and urgency unclear.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): There are many useful C23 `<math.h>` features that should be provided in C++.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): The goal of this proposal is to pull in all the new C23 `<math.h>` features which are useful not only to decimal floating-point numbers.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): The problem is that when lvalue-to-rvalue conversion takes place, only the *value*, not the exact bit pattern (value representation) of an object is being carried by prvalues.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 33 passes): A pre-existing defect is that classification functions such as `signbit` take their parameter by value.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): [[P3348R4]](https://wg21%2elink/p3348r4) rebased the C++26 standard on C23; it previously referred to C17.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): ISO/IEC 60559 op.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): All non-template additions are taken from C23, and most have been implemented in gnulibc.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 33 passes): To solve this, R1 of the paper proposed additional function templates such as: ... However, this would create a strange overload set with the existing `fadd` functions (where the `f` prefix indicates `float`).
