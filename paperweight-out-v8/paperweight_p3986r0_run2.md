Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow foundation for its own standardization: it establishes why the problem matters, but leaves nearly every other necessary showing unaddressed or merely gestured at through references to P3425. The support is thinnest around the absence of any demonstrated need for a standard mechanism, any interoperability analysis, or any implementation experience.

- The paper does establish that implementers face a real gap between needing to compute completion functions and lacking code to perform that computation.
- Its treatment of prior art and alternatives rests entirely on claims about P3425, without independently establishing that the referenced strategy is sufficient or accepted.
- The paper provides no evidence about who is affected, why a library solution would be inadequate, or how the proposal coordinates with existing or planned features.
- Most glaringly, it offers no implementation experience and no argument that the standard itself is the right place for this work.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): The receiver needs to know the location of the operation state to which asynchronous control flows upon completion of a child operation.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 18 passes): The above has the effect that implementers of `std::execution` must write code which computes the completion functions potentially-evaluated by the algorithms they are implementing, but does not provide code which performs that computation.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 18 passes): The situation is not quite as dire as is presented in the preceding section.

candidate 2 (found by 2 of 18 passes): The above is the primary finding of P3425.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 18 passes): A similar strategy can be used to word P3425:
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 18 passes): This paper proposes a strategy for wording the changes proposed by P3425 [1].
