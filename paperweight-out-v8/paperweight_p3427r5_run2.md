Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers some concrete grounding for its proposal, chiefly through the Folly implementation and production use, but much of the standardization rationale is asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest support appears where the paper needs to show why this belongs in the standard, why a library cannot suffice, and how it would coordinate with existing facilities.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, with object cohorts in production use in Folly since 2018.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives by contrasting object cohorts with global cleanup and explaining the performance tradeoff.
- The rationale for why the standard should adopt this, rather than leaving it as a library feature, is claimed but not substantiated.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of an established case for coordination and interoperability with existing hazard pointer or reclamation facilities.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This paper proposes supporting object cohorts due to the importance of synchronous reclamation for general purpose usability.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Object cohorts have been part of the Folly open-source library (under the name `hazptr_obj_cohort`) and in heavy use in production since 2018.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The P2530R3 C++26 hazard pointer interface supports only asynchronous reclamation which does not guarantee the timing of the reclamation of protectable objects that are no longer protected.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): While its guarantees are weaker and less flexible than global cleanup, its efficiency enables users to use it in performance sensitive cases where the cost of global cleanup may be impractical.

candidate 2 (found by 2 of 36 passes): For example, a concurrent hash map that uses hazard pointers is more generally usable if it allows arbitrary key and value types rather than only types without dependence on resources with independent lifetimes.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): The main advantage of the object cohort approach is its performance.
