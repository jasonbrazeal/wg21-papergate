Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper gives a partial account of why its proposed basis operation might matter and what alternatives it is responding to, but it leaves several core standardization questions essentially unaddressed. The strongest material concerns the problem framing and the limits of existing executor-based approaches, while the thinnest concerns who would actually be affected, why this belongs in the standard rather than a library, and how it would interoperate with existing practice.

- The paper establishes that error handling under the work framing is implementation-defined and that the handle type imposes real constraints on the callable.
- It also establishes that the prior papers driving the pivot did not engage with the continuation framing or `async_result`, and that coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` serve complementary domains.
- The claim that a library solution cannot suffice is only asserted through a survey of error-handling strategies, without a demonstration that the proposed basis operation is necessary in the standard.
- The paper does not establish who is affected, why standardization is required, how the feature would coordinate with existing facilities, or that there is implementation experience behind the design.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): "Any errors that happen, whether during task submission, after submission and prior to execution, or during task execution, are handled in an implementation-defined manner, which can vary from executor to executor."
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The four deficiencies are real under the work framing. Under the continuation framing, three do not arise and the fourth addresses a different question.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): The handle type constrains the callable to `coroutine_handle<>` - a fixed-size, type-erased handle with exactly two operations:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The three papers that drove the pivot - [P1525R0], [P1658R0], [P1660R0] - do not mention `async_result`, [N3747], or the continuation framing.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The coroutine executor concept ([P4003R3](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P4003R3.pdf) [5]) makes the continuation framing concrete:
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary. Each serves the domain where its design choices pay off.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): The paper identified four deficiencies and proposed an alternative basis operation.
