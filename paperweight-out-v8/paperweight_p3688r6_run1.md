Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper gives a partial account of why these ASCII utilities might belong in the standard, with its clearest support coming from the limitations of existing headers and the availability of a reference implementation. The case is thinnest around the need for standardization itself, since the paper leans on asserted ubiquity rather than demonstrating that users cannot be adequately served by ordinary libraries.

- The strongest support is the identification of concrete problems with `<cctype>` and `<locale>`, including locale dependence, lack of `constexpr`, and missing Unicode character type support.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives by pointing to `std::locale` overloads, a Compiler Explorer implementation, and related deprecation work.
- The claim that working with ASCII is overwhelmingly common is asserted rather than shown with evidence about affected users or codebases.
- The paper does not address coordination or interoperability with existing or proposed character-handling facilities, leaving a significant gap in the standardization case.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): The utilities in `<cctype>` or `<locale>` are locale-specific, not `constexpr`, and provide no support for Unicode character types.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Unfortunately, these common and simple tasks are only supported through functions in the `<cctype>` and `<locale>` headers, such as:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Many of these problems are resolved by the `std::locale` overloads in `<locale>`, but their locale dependence makes them unfit for what this proposal aims to achieve.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): A naive implementation of all proposed functions can be found at [[CompilerExplorer]](https://godbolt%2eorg/z/5nvWzdf8G), although these are implemented as function templates, not as overload sets (as proposed).
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 30 passes): However, these uses of `static_cast` may improve readability and avoid the use of behavior which is proposed to be deprecated in [[P3695R0]](https://wg21%2elink/p3695r0).
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 30 passes): We propose lightweight, locale-independent alternatives.
