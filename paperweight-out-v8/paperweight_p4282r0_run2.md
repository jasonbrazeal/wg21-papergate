Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers a narrow but genuine basis for revisiting `std::execution::task`, resting almost entirely on the adoption of P3950 and the resulting change in what the working draft permits. Beyond that, the case for standardization is largely undeveloped: the affected audience, the need for a standard rather than a library solution, interoperability concerns, and implementation experience are all left unaddressed.

- The strongest support is the established connection to P3950, which the paper correctly identifies as having changed the landscape and made this revision possible.
- The paper also establishes a concrete prior limitation: coroutine bodies using `std::execution::task` previously had to `co_await std::execution::just_stopped()` to emit a stopped signal.
- The thinnest area is the absence of any discussion of who is affected by the change or why the standard, rather than a library, is the right place for it.
- Most glaringly, the paper provides no implementation experience and no coordination or interoperability analysis, leaving the practical and ecosystem implications entirely unexamined.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): While `std::execution::task` supports stopped completion signals the promise type has no bona fide manner in which the coroutine body can emit them.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Previously if the author of a coroutine body which uses `std::execution::task` wished to end the asynchronous operation with stopped they had to write `co_await` `std::execution::just_stopped()`.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): P3950 [1] proposed changing the above.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): P3950 has now been accepted into the C++29 working draft and therefore the above can be revisited.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): This paper updates the design and wording of `std::execution::task` given the adoption of P3950 [1].
