Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a thin and largely rhetorical case for its own standardization, with most of its argument resting on asserted confusion and a single meeting poll rather than on demonstrated need or technical necessity. The support is thinnest where the proposal should be strongest: it does not establish why the standard is the right venue, why a library solution would be inadequate, or how the feature would interoperate with existing practice.

- The clearest support comes from the paper’s attempt to connect its naming concern to ongoing discussion in P3804R1, though even that is presented as a claim about alternatives rather than a settled comparison.
- The paper gestures at community relevance through a Kona poll, but it does not show who is concretely affected or how the confusion it predicts would arise in practice.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any implementation experience or coordination discussion, leaving the proposal without evidence that the change is feasible or aligned with existing ecosystem conventions.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): Adding `system_context_replaceability` namespace name to C++26 will cause a lot of confusion because `system_context` does not even exist in the current working draft.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 15 passes): [[P3804R1]](https://wg21.link/p3804r1) proposed several options favoring `replacement` and `replacement_functions`. As people pointed out, those names are probably also not great because they don’t give any sense of what developers try to replace.
