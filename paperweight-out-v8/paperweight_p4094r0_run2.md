Verdict: Adequate to Strong (6/14)

The paper offers a mixed case for its own standardization, with its strongest material going to historical context, prior art, and the existence of alternatives, while the arguments about who is affected, interoperability, and implementation experience remain asserted rather than demonstrated. The support is thinnest where the proposal needs to show why this belongs in the standard at all and why a library solution would not suffice.

- The paper establishes that the unification decision had real downstream costs and that revisiting consequential choices is a legitimate stewardship concern.
- It credibly documents prior art and alternatives, including the precedent of a type that already fuses two async models.
- It claims but does not establish that a single scheduler cannot serve networking, GPU, and thread pool use cases together, leaving the affected audience unclear.
- It offers no established case for why the standard is the right venue or why a library cannot address the problem.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The unification of three working executor models had unanticipated downstream consequences.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The cross product of N facilities and M algorithms grows without bound. Standard library maintainers who would implement N x M combinations had legitimate reason to want N + M.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The coupling between networking and executors is documented in published papers. The timeline is observable. Is this a cost of unification, or would networking have been delayed regardless?
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Good stewardship of the standard means revisiting consequential decisions when new evidence is available.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary. Each serves the domain where its design choices pay off.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): It replaced the property system with CPO-based queries and centered the design on senders and receivers.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): This paper examines the published record for the evidence that supported the unification decision and documents a terminology shift that erased the continuation framing from the API surface of [P0443R14].
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): The `task` precedent is the sharpest - the committee has already voted to ship a type that fuses two async models into one.
