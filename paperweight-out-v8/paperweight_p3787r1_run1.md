Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a thin basis for its own standardization, resting almost entirely on the assertion that an oversight left `uninitialized_fill` out of a previously adopted change. It does not establish who is affected, why a library solution would be insufficient, or how the change fits into the broader standard, and even its strongest points are presented as claims rather than demonstrated support.

- The clearest support is the paper’s alignment with P2248R8, which it cites as an adopted precedent for the same kind of change applied to related algorithms.
- The paper gestures at implementation experience by noting that implementations already ship with P2248R8, but it does not show any implementation of the proposed change itself.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any discussion of who is affected or why the problem matters in practice, leaving the need for standardization largely unsubstantiated.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Due to an oversight, the `std::uninitialized_fill` family of algorithms was excluded from the ones where a defaulted template parameter was added.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): We extend the same changes that [P2248R8] applied to the rest of the find algorithms to `std(::ranges)::uninitialized_fill`.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): In the Tokyo 2024 meeting [P2248R8] (Enabling list-initialization for algorithms) was adopted.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): [P3217R0] was also submitted as a similar fix for `find_last`.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): We propose to modify `uninitialized_fill`’s specification, so that it matches the post-P2248 one for the rest of the algorithms (especially `fill`).

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 21 passes): there are already implementations shipping with [P2248R8], and therefore we consider it safer to bump the value again.
