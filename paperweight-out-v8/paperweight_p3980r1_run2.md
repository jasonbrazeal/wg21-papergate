Verdict: Weak to Adequate (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow slice of the case for standardization: it can point to prior discussion and a stated committee preference, but it does not establish who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, how the change coordinates with existing practice, or whether anyone has implemented it. The thinnest areas are the complete absence of implementation experience and the lack of any argument that a library solution would be insufficient.

- The strongest support is the record of prior art and committee discussion, including the LEWG preference for putting `allocator_arg` first.
- The paper claims the change matters because it would make optional allocator support easier, but it does not connect that to concrete users or use cases.
- The paper does not establish why this requires a standard change rather than a library-level convention or wrapper.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any implementation experience, leaving the practical consequences of the proposed ordering entirely unverified.

  [5] 4 Use Allocator From Environment             0/0/0  -> 0.00
candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The current specification uses the same allocator for coroutine frame and the child environments.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The main benefit is that support of an optional allocator can be supported by having a trailing `, auto&&...` on the parameter list.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 15 passes): The status quo is anywhere, and the request is to require that it goes first.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 15 passes): There are a few NB comments about `task`’s use of allocators

  [5] 4 Use Allocator From Environment             1/1/1  -> 1.00
candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The current specification uses the same allocator for coroutine frame and the child environments.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): At the LEWG meeting on 2026-02-03 the first approach (putting the `allocator_arg` first, Wording Change A) was preferred ([notes](https://wiki.isocpp.org/2026-02-03_LEWG_Telecon)).
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 15 passes): During the discussion at Kona the conclusion was that the allocator forwarded by `task`’s environment to child senders should be the allocator from `get_allocator` on the receiver `task` gets `connect`ed to.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 15 passes): The status quo is anywhere, and the request is to require that it goes first. However, to support optionally passing an allocator, having it go anywhere is easier to do.
