Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers some grounding for its standardization case through implementation experience and a brief statement of the problem, but it leaves most of the burden of justification unaddressed, particularly around who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, and how the feature would coordinate with existing library practice.

- The strongest support comes from implementation experience, with both range-v3 and the author’s Beman project implementation cited as evidence the design is workable.
- The paper establishes why the feature matters by framing `views::scan` as a lazy, stateful counterpart to `transform` and a common functional programming operation.
- Prior art and alternatives are only claimed rather than established, since the references to range-v3 and the Ranges plan are mentioned without a substantive comparison or analysis of tradeoffs.
- The most glaring omissions are the absence of any discussion of who is affected, why a standard library component is necessary, or how the proposal interoperates with existing standard facilities.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Basically, `views::scan` is a lazy view version of `std::inclusive_scan`, or `views::transform` with a stateful function.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): But there are many cases where you need a `transform` to that is stateful.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Scan is a pretty common operation in functional programming.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The `views::scan` adaptor is classified as a Tier 1 item in the Ranges plan for C++26 ([P2760R1]).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The wording below is based on [N5032], and assumes that [P3117R1]’s `tidy-func` concept is already applied on top.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): The author implemented this proposal in [beman.scan_view](https://github.com/bemanproject/scan_view) as part of Beman Project.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Currently the wording uses the latter (following range-v3), but `transform_view` used the former.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): This adaptor is also present in ranges-v3, where it is called `views::partial_sum` with the function parameter defaulted to `std::plus{}`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): range-v3 has a [`views::partial_sum` adaptor](https://ericniebler.github.io/range-v3/structranges_1_1partial__sum__view.html) that don’t take initial seeds, but takes arbitrary function parameter (defaults to `+`).
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The author implemented this proposal in [beman.scan_view](https://github.com/bemanproject/scan_view) as part of Beman Project.
