Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers some grounding for its core motivation and for the existence of prior art, but it leaves several essential parts of the standardization case almost entirely unaddressed, especially around affected users, interoperability, and why a library solution would be insufficient. The thinnest support is in the areas that would normally justify bringing the work into the standard rather than leaving it as an implementation or extension.

- The strongest support is the explanation of why reference-returning asynchronous completions matter, grounded in the familiar synchronous behavior of functions like `std::vector::operator[]`.
- The discussion of prior art is also useful, particularly the removal of reference-completing `std::execution::split` and the comparison to destructor behavior in synchronous returns.
- The paper does not establish who is affected by the proposed change, leaving the scope and audience of the problem unclear.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established case for why a library cannot provide the capability, which is central to justifying standardization.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Synchronous functions are capable of returning references. This is uncontroversial. Some of the first functions new C++ developers interact with return references (e.g. `std::vector::operator[]`). Therefore it stands to reason that asynchronous functions should have this capability as well.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The distinction between a by-value completion and an rvalue-reference completion is not what will be deduced by a generic/forwarding `set_value` member function of the receiver, but rather what the ownership model is for that particular argument to the completion.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): While `complete` is convenient as an API it admits only one modality by which the stored completion (if any) can be consumed: Completing an asynchronous operation by sending a completion signal to a receiver.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): It was removed before C++26 shipped [6] (note that the fact `std::execution::split` completed with references meant that it was the asynchronous analogue of a function which returns a reference to a local variable
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Consider the previously-standard [6] algorithm which advertised and sent lvalue references: `std::execution::split` [5].
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This pattern is seen in the synchronous domain when destructors are run on exit from a function.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This paper has been implemented against nVidia’s reference implementation of `std::execution` [?].
