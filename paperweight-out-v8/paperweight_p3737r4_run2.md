Verdict: Strong (9/14)

The paper offers solid grounding for its core motivation and for the existence of compatible implementation practice, but it leaves several parts of the standardization case asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest support concerns why a library solution is insufficient and whether the affected audience and standards-level need are actually shown.

- The paper clearly establishes that the current specification is more permissive than necessary and that a simplified, widely implemented behavior would be beneficial.
- It also establishes meaningful prior art and implementation experience by documenting how libstdc++ and libc++ already behave and identifying MSVC STL as the outlier.
- The claims about who is affected and why standardization is the right remedy are stated, but the paper does not substantiate them with evidence of user impact or demand.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any case for why a library-level solution cannot address the problem, leaving that required justification entirely unestablished.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): However, its specification in the standard is considerably more permissive and should be simplified.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): It would be beneficial to the C++ community if the simplified explanation in §2. Introduction was what the standard actually said.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The zero-length case is also where we see some implementation divergence in size and alignment of the array.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The `std::array` class template has established itself as a de-facto replacement for "builtin arrays" or "C-style arrays" in many code bases.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The MSVC STL implements zero-length `std::array`s incorrectly and does not comply with C++26 (or any prior standard), and fixing this would require an ABI break.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The "greatest common denominator" between these implementations (excluding MSVC STL) should be standardized, which is: - `std::array<T, 0>` is trivially copyable. - `std::array<T, 0>` is assignable if `T` is.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The "greatest common denominator" between these implementations (excluding MSVC STL) should be standardized, which is: ...
