Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers a clear motivation for the feature and a useful account of prior art, but it leaves the standardization case largely implicit. The thinnest parts are the absence of any discussion of who is affected, why this belongs in the standard rather than a library, and how it would coordinate with existing or planned facilities.

- The strongest support is the explanation of why asynchronous functions need reference-completion semantics and what the proposal’s primitive would add beyond existing completion APIs.
- The discussion of prior art, including the removal of `std::execution::split` and the comparison with `std::visit`, grounds the design in known problems and alternatives.
- The paper does not establish who is affected by the problem or what user communities would benefit from standardization.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any argument for why the standard is the right venue, or why a library implementation would not suffice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Synchronous functions are capable of returning references. This is uncontroversial. Some of the first functions new C++ developers interact with return references (e.g. `std::vector::operator[]`). Therefore it stands to reason that asynchronous functions should have this capability as well.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The distinction between a by-value completion and an rvalue-reference completion is not what will be deduced by a generic/forwarding `set_value` member function of the receiver, but rather what the ownership model is for that particular argument to the completion.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): While `complete` is convenient as an API it admits only one modality by which the stored completion (if any) can be consumed: Completing an asynchronous operation by sending a completion signal to a receiver.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 36 passes): It provides no support for simply inspecting the stored completion, nor does it provide support for combining completions.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): It was removed before C++26 shipped [6] (note that the fact `std::execution::split` completed with references meant that it was the asynchronous analogue of a function which returns a reference to a local variable
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Consider the previously-standard [6] algorithm which advertised and sent lvalue references: `std::execution::split` [5].
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This paper has been implemented against nVidia’s reference implementation of `std::execution` [?].
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): At first mirroring the interface of `std::visit` seems appropriate with no completion represented by `std::monostate`. However this falls apart as we once again consider application of this primitive to `std::execution::when_all`.
