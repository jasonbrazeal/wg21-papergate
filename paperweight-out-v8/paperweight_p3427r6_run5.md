Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers a solid foundation for its standardization case in the areas of real-world use and prior art, but it leaves several essential arguments more asserted than demonstrated. The thinnest support concerns why this belongs in the standard rather than remaining a library facility, and how it would coordinate with existing or future reclamation mechanisms.

- The strongest support comes from the documented production use of object cohorts in Folly since 2018, which grounds the proposal in practical experience.
- The discussion of alternatives and the contrast with global cleanup gives readers a clear sense of where object cohorts fit among existing approaches.
- The paper does not adequately establish who is affected beyond a general appeal to performance-sensitive users.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of a convincing argument for why a library implementation cannot suffice, since the cited efficiency benefits do not by themselves show a need for standardization.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This paper proposes supporting object cohorts due to the importance of synchronous reclamation for general purpose usability.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Object cohorts have been part of the Folly open-source library (under the name `hazptr_obj_cohort`) and in heavy use in production since 2018.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): While its guarantees are weaker and less flexible than global cleanup, its efficiency enables users to use it in performance sensitive cases where the cost of global cleanup may be impractical.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): If a cohort is long-lived, large numbers (e.g., billions) of objects may be retired to it. If such objects are not included in asynchronous reclamation, they would remain not reclaimed.

candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): An alternative approach is the use of object cohorts, which are sets of protectable objects.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The following table shows two code snippets one using the P2530R3 C++26 hazard pointer interface and one using object cohorts, respectively.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Therefore a free function hazard_pointer_try_reclamation() is added, so that users can write the cohort equivalent to the above non-cohort code snippet as follows:
