Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper gives a reasonably solid account of why defaulted postfix operators would be useful and how the idea fits existing standardization patterns, but it leaves several practical questions unanswered. The thinnest parts concern evidence that the feature would actually be adopted, that it cannot be handled adequately by a library, and that it has been tried in practice.

- The strongest support is the explanation of the canonical meaning of postfix increment and decrement and the boilerplate that defaulting them would remove.
- The paper also credibly situates the proposal in the history of defaulted comparisons and shows awareness of prior art and alternatives.
- The claim that most affected classes would benefit is asserted without data or examples showing how widespread the need is.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any implementation experience or demonstration that a library solution is insufficient.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Postfix increment and decrement operators have a near-universal canonical definition.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): This reduces boilerplate code while still expressing the universally-known meaning of the function.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): The issue with a rewrite rule is that increment and decrement operators are not as suitable for implicit operations as equality and comparison ones.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 39 passes): There are several existing approaches to attempt a similar reduction in boilerplate. Our position is that none of them quite find the best way to express user intent in code, and will examine them here.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): The majority of classes written with postfix operations can now simply default them and get an operator which does the right thing.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): It is worth noting that there has been a persistent interest in saving user boilerplate when defining operator overloads with canonical definitions, such as speculated on in [P0436].
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): It was intentionally decided not to add a feature test macro for this proposal, as it would have minimal benefit.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): We do not believe that there is any incompatibility between this paper and P3662.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 39 passes): This follows the lead of the C++20 comparison changes to defaulted functions, which were largely defined in their own [[class.compare.default]](https://eel.is/c++draft/class.compare.default) clause.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Standardising a "default" behaviour for postfix operations would also allow us to shrink the library specification, by expressing operations which are specified to be equivalent to the canonical implementation as being default.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): There is also benefit in standardising the way to retrieve this default - multiple libraries might all ship their own `incrementable` or `postfix_increment()` variants, which may make slightly different design choices.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 39 passes): The issue with a rewrite rule is that increment and decrement operators are not as suitable for implicit operations as equality and comparison ones.
