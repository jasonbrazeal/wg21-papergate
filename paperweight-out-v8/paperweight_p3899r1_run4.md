Verdict: Adequate (7/14)

The paper offers a reasonable foundation for its standardization case in the areas of motivation, prior art, and implementation experience, but it leaves several essential justifications largely unaddressed, particularly why the standard is the right venue and why a library solution would be insufficient. The thinnest support concerns the necessity of core language action and the completeness of the affected-user and interoperability evidence.

- The strongest support comes from the demonstrated implementation experience, especially GCC 15’s exact match with the proposed behavior and the comparative compiler table.
- The paper also establishes clear motivation by identifying ambiguity in the current specification and the practical breakage of existing constant expressions.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is adequately grounded in SG6 guidance and consistency with mathematical functions.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established argument for why the standard must change, rather than relying on a library-level or implementation-level resolution.

candidate 1 (found by 6 of 27 passes): The current specification of floating-point overflow is unclear.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): There is little motivation to have the core language and the library diverge in this area.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Existing code that relied on `max() * 2` being a constant expression will fail to compile.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): It is also worth noting that on [[CWG2168]](https://cplusplus%2egithub%2eio/CWG/issues/2168%2ehtml), SG6 gave some guidance:
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): This approach is consistent with the design of mathematical functions; for example, `exp(1'000'000)` results in a range error, meaning that infinity is returned and the expression is not constant.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): GCC 15 implements the proposed behavior exactly. Clang and MSVC compilers deviate only slightly.
