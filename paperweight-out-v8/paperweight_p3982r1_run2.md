Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper offers some useful grounding for its proposal, particularly through concrete implementation work and a survey of prior art, but it leaves much of the case for standardization asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest support concerns why a library solution would be insufficient, which is not addressed at all.

- The strongest support comes from the implementation experience, with a patch series and benchmark details showing the proposed wording changes have been worked through in libstdc++.
- The survey of slicing interfaces in other languages is credited as establishing prior art and alternatives.
- The paper claims but does not establish who is affected, relying on a mention of benchmark results without showing how they demonstrate impact.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any argument for why a library will not do, leaving the need for standardization itself unaddressed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): it gives `submdspan` a more ergonomic and familiar interface.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): This shows that even for programmers familar with the topic, such computations remain bug-prone.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): This paper proposes two changes: 1. Rename `strided_slice` to `extent_slice` and adjust the meaning of its `extent` member, to designate the desired number of elements in the range produced by `submdspan`.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): One argument for using the *input span* as the value of `stride_slice::extent` was consistency with other programming languages' range slicing interfaces. However, surveying the slicing interface in common languages shows that they all use `first, last` instead of `offset, length`.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): However, surveying the slicing interface in common languages shows that they all use `first, last` instead of `offset, length`.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 27 passes): `strided_slice` is one of the canonical slice types that define the interface between `submdspan` (and potentially other components providing such facility) and custom layouts.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 27 passes): As this document explains, the current specification of `strided_slice` fails in both accounts.
