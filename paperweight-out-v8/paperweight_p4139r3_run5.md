Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers a narrow but genuine case that the name `get` is a poor fit for the operation forwarded in P3091, and it documents the naming alternatives that were considered. Its support is almost entirely confined to naming consistency, while the broader question of why this change belongs in the standard is left unaddressed.

- The paper establishes why the existing `get` name is inconsistent with established library conventions and would create confusion.
- It shows that prior naming alternatives were considered and rejected, giving useful context for the discussion.
- Its claim that bad names do real harm is asserted rather than demonstrated with concrete impact.
- The paper does not establish why the standard must act, why a library solution is insufficient, or how the change would interoperate with existing practice.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 24 passes): Since that time, even the author of P3091 has reconsidered the implications of the name `get`.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 24 passes): The name of the desired operation should reflect that the lookup may take variable time and could return without finding the value being sought; existing instances of `get` in the Library forbid both.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 24 passes): In hope of making the C++26 cutoff, the naming discussion was curtailed and the name in P3091 was retained when that paper was forwarded in Sofia.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 24 passes): We conclude that a `get` function returning `optional` after an unbounded search would make it unique among uses of `get` in the library, and so would be inconsistent and confusing.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): [[P3091R5]](https://wg21.link/p3091r5), forwarded to LWG for C++29, adds member functions `get` to associative containers in the Standard Library.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): P3091 offered names `get_optional` and `lookup_optional`, which failed to evoke enthusiasm in Sofia; and `lookup`, which had supporters, but failed to reach consensus.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 24 passes): It is common to downplay the importance of naming, but bad names do real harm.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 24 passes): The name `get_optional` mentioned in P3091 is not proposed, for reasons that should be clear.
