Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers only a thin case for standardization, resting almost entirely on the existence of analogous functionality in `inplace_vector` and a general sense that the operations would be useful. The support is thinnest where a proposal needs to be most concrete: it does not establish why this belongs in the standard, why a library solution is insufficient, or how the feature would coordinate with existing container guarantees.

- The strongest support is the prior art, since the paper can point to `try_push_back` and `try_emplace_back` already standardized for `inplace_vector` in P0843R7.
- The motivation is asserted rather than demonstrated, with only a brief remark that low-latency systems commonly pre-allocate maximum vector capacity.
- The affected audience is similarly claimed but not substantiated, leaving the actual user base and its needs unclear.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any argument for why the standard, rather than a library, is the right vehicle, compounded by no discussion of implementation experience or interoperability.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Now that we have `try_*_back` in `inplace_vector`, we should add it to `vector` and explore adding it to other sequence containers that provide `push_back` and `emplace_back`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): However, there is currently no method to set the capacity, so it is not quite as useful here.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): They are just as useful in `vector`.

candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): One could generalize this even more to `deque` so that it returns an `optional&lt;T&>` that is engaged if and only if the `deque` did not perform an internal allocation
