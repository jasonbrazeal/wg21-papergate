Verdict: Excellent (12/14)

The paper offers substantial support for most of the standardization case, with detailed evidence of performance benefits, implementation experience, and a clear account of why existing tools and the C `#embed` facility are insufficient for the full C++ use case. The support is thinnest around coordination and interoperability, where the paper does not establish how the feature would interact with build systems, modules, or other standardization efforts.

- The strongest support is the concrete implementation experience in both Clang and GCC, including specific flags and patch locations, which demonstrates feasibility beyond a paper design.
- The paper also clearly establishes why a library-only solution will not do, citing compiler-specific workarounds and the performance superiority of `std::embed` over optimized trunk builds.
- The case for prior art and alternatives is well grounded, showing continuity with C23/C++26 `#embed` while explaining why a function-based `consteval` approach adds necessary power.
- The most glaring omission is coordination and interoperability, where the paper leaves unaddressed how the feature would work with build systems, module boundaries, or existing resource-inclusion conventions.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The above clearly demonstrates the superiority of `std::embed` over latest optimized trunk builds of various compilers.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): One of the biggest benefits of `std::embed` is that it’s a normal, regular `consteval` function call.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): A proposal for a function that allows pulling resources at compile-time into a program, and a preprocessor directive to make finding those resources feasible for compilers and build systems.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): Many different tools and practices were adapted to handle this, as far back as 1995 with the `xxd` tool.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): A simpler, C-friendly, preprocessor-only version of this functionality was standardized in C++26 and C23 with `#embed <file> params...`, which solved the problem for C and C-adjacent use cases.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): It was Circle’s conclusion that a generic API was unsuitable and suffered from the same performance pitfalls that currently plagued current-generation compilers today.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): There is a tool called [incbin] which is a 3rd party attempt at pulling files in at "assembly time". Its approach is incredibly similar to `ld`, with the caveat that files must be shipped with their binary.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): It proposed the syntax `F"my_file.txt"` and `bF"my_file.txt"`, with a few other amenities, to load files at compilation time.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Should this really be delegated to Quality of Implementation that will be need to be solved N times over by every implementation in their own particularly special way?
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): There is precedent for specifying library features that are implemented only through compile-time compiler intrinsics (`type_traits`, `source_location`, and similar utilities).
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): A simpler, C-friendly, preprocessor-only version of this functionality was standardized in C++26 and C23 with `#embed <file> params...`, which solved the problem for C and C-adjacent use cases.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): The goal is to have it implemented with compiler intrinsics, builtins, or other suitable mechanisms.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The above clearly demonstrates the superiority of `std::embed` over latest optimized trunk builds of various compilers.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This scales a little bit better in terms of raw compilation time but is shockingly OS, vendor and platform specific in ways that novice developers would not be able to handle fully.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): Many different tools and practices were adapted to handle this, as far back as 1995 with the `xxd` tool.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): This allows someone much greater degrees of freedom and power than is capable with either `#embed` or `_Pragma("embed ...")`, as it allows someone to use other constant expression parsing facilities along the introduction of file-based data.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The current implementation uses `-fembed-path=some/path/here/` to indicate this, but when it is standardized there will probably be an `-RI` or `-resource-include` flag instead.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 36 passes): a proper implementation has been completed in LLVM/Clang trunk and in GCC trunk as of April 25th, 2026, though they are not integrated into main/trunk of either compiler yet. They can be viewed here: https://github.com/ThePhD/embed/tree/main/patches
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 36 passes): Finally, a proper implementation has been completed in LLVM/Clang trunk and in GCC trunk as of April 25th, 2026, though they are not integrated into main/trunk of either compiler yet.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 36 passes): As the current implementation does, manipulating `--embed-dir=` similar to the way `#include` is handled alongside `-I` flags is a much better use of not only implementer time, but programmer time.
