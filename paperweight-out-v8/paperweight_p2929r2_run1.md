Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a narrow, motivational sketch for the proposed facility, and most of the case for standardization is asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest areas are the absence of any identified user population, the lack of evidence that a library solution is insufficient, and the silence on implementation experience or coordination with existing practice.

- The strongest support is the paper’s explanation of why a programmer might want to invoke a lambda over smaller pieces of a SIMD value, though even this remains a claim about convenience rather than an established need.
- The discussion of naming and alignment with existing `std::simd` functions shows some awareness of prior art, but it does not establish that the proposed design is the right or necessary alternative.
- The paper does not identify who is affected by the problem or provide evidence that the verbosity it describes is a widespread burden.
- Most glaringly, it offers no implementation experience, no argument for why a library cannot provide the facility, and no reason the feature belongs in the standard rather than in user code or a third-party library.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Proposal to extend `std::simd` with a method of allowing a lambda to be invoked on smaller pieces of a SIMD value in order to make interaction with intrinsics easier.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): However, it is inevitable that the programmer will want to make some use of target-specific intrinsics in order to unlock some of the more unusual features of those specific platforms.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Being able to define a different size is useful for two reasons:
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): The boiler-plate code needed to handle this is technically straight-forward, but verbose.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The function is named `chunked_invoke` and placed in `std::simd` to directly align with related established functions such as `chunk` and `cat`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The draft standard of `std::simd` recommends that provision is made for conversions to and from implementation defined types.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): In the first revision of this paper we proposed that the function which invokes a Callable with an explicit offset should be called with a `_indexed` suffix (e.g., `simd::chunked_invoke_indexed`).
