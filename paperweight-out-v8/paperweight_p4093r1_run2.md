Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers meaningful support in a few areas, particularly its account of prior art and the existence of a working implementation, but it leaves several essential parts of the standardization case largely unaddressed. The thinnest support concerns who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, and why a library solution cannot suffice.

- The strongest support is the concrete implementation experience, including a complete implementation and maintained related libraries.
- The paper also establishes the prior-art landscape clearly, showing how existing sender and coroutine options fail to preserve both values and composition.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established argument for why this work belongs in the standard rather than in a library.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 48 passes): Awaitables returning compound I/O results - any tuple-like whose first element is `error_code` with additional elements - are rejected at compile time.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 48 passes): Neither option preserves both values and retains composition.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 48 passes): The coroutine body is the translation layer: inspect the compound result, perform application logic, return the error code.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 48 passes): An `IoAwaitable` ([P4003R3](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P4003R3.pdf) [1]) can be wrapped as a `std::execution` sender.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 48 passes): `as_sender` wraps any `IoAwaitable` as a `std::execution` sender.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 48 passes): [P4090R0](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P4090R0.pdf) [7] documented the trade-off: route the whole pair through `set_value` and the composition algebra is bypassed; decompose it and the byte count is destroyed on error because `set_error` carries only the `error_code`.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 48 passes): Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary. Each serves the domain where its design choices pay off.
