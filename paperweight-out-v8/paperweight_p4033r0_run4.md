Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers a reasonably grounded case in the areas of motivation, alternatives, and implementation experience, but it leaves several essential standardization questions largely unaddressed. The support is thinnest around coordination with existing or planned reflection facilities and around why the feature cannot be delivered as a library.

- The strongest support comes from the demonstrated implementation experience, including a working example and a linked compiler fork.
- The paper also establishes a clear motivation by showing how index-based switch tables break silently when variant alternatives change.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is credited, particularly the contrast with `define_aggregate` and the direct support for annotations and attributes.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established case for coordination and interoperability with the broader reflection ecosystem.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): If variant<Dog, Tanuki, Cat> is later augmented with variant<Dog, Tanuki, Racoon, Cat>, or the variant are shuffled, the index-based switch table will break silently, not the enum based one.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 24 passes): Synthesizing enumerators of a scoped enum is a fairly simple operation, on the other hand rewiring the proper context for enumerators of an unscoped enum is quite more troublesome and error prone.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 24 passes): Synthesizing enumerators of a scoped enum is a fairly simple operation, on the other hand rewiring the proper context for enumerators of an unscoped enum is quite more troublesome and error prone...

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): The generative capability of reflection as they were introduced in C++26 are limited to `define_aggregate`, with no quick paths to more powerful facilities (See [p3294r2] for example).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Our rationale behind this conservative approach is entirely rooted in our implementation experience (granted not extensive).
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Diverging with the original design of `define_aggregate()`, annotations and attributes are directly supported here via `.annotations` and `.attributes`.
