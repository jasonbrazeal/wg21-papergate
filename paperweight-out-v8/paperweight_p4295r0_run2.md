Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers only a narrow basis for its own standardization: it can point to prior art and a partial implementation, but it leaves the central justifications—who is affected, why the standard should contain this facility, and why a library cannot suffice—essentially unargued. The thinnest support concerns the very need for standardization, since the motivating importance of bounded concurrent queues is asserted rather than demonstrated.

- The strongest support is the existence of prior art, since the single-ended interface appeared in an earlier concurrent queue proposal before being separated out.
- The paper also offers some implementation experience through a partial implementation available online.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established reason why this belongs in the standard rather than in a library.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Bounded concurrent queues are an important communication mechanism.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): So it helps code structure to provide a helper that gives access to only one end of a queue.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): It depends on the specific usage scenario of a queue who’s responsible for closing a queue (if at all).

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): This paper proposes two templates that works with any `concurrent_queue` [P0260](https://wg21.link/P0260) that provide only one part of the queue interface.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The single ended interfaces for concurrent queues was in the very first concurrent queue proposal [C++ Concurrent Queues](https://wg21.link/n3353) and was removed by SG1 to make it a separate class.
