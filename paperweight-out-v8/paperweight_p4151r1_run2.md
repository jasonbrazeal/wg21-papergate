Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a narrow, name-focused rationale for its proposal, and that rationale is asserted rather than demonstrated. Its thinnest support lies in the absence of any discussion of affected users, standardization need, interoperability, library feasibility, or implementation experience.

- The strongest support is the claim that a prior interface change made the existing name misleading, with the paper citing discussion where the author connected that change to renaming.
- The paper gestures at prior art by recounting the algorithm’s earlier binary design and its later unary redesign.
- The most glaring omission is that the paper never establishes who is affected by the proposed change or why the standard, rather than a library or guidance, is the right vehicle for it.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Rendering `std::execution::affine_on` unary [2] destroys the rationale for including “on” in the name thereof.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 27 passes): changing the shape of the interface warranted changing the name of the algorithm
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): it was mentioned (by the author of this paper) that changing the shape of the interface warranted changing the name of the algorithm

candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): During LEWG discussion of the above (2026-03-24 in Croydon) it was mentioned (by the author of this paper) that changing the shape of the interface warranted changing the name of the algorithm
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): Later [2] it was redesigned to be unary accepting only a sender (the first bullet from above).
