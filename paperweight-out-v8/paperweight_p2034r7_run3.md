Verdict: Strong (9/14)

The paper offers solid grounding for why const-qualified lambda captures matter and shows that the feature is implementable without deep language redesign, but it leaves several essential parts of the standardization case asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest support concerns the need for a standard-language solution specifically, as opposed to a library workaround, and the absence of any account of who is affected.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, including a working compiler branch and a proof-of-concept completed in a single afternoon.
- The paper also establishes why the feature matters, particularly the desire for logical const correctness and a more orthogonal lambda syntax.
- Prior art and alternatives are adequately covered, including the evolution of const-correct standard callable types and the limitations of `std::cref`.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any established audience or affected-user analysis, which weakens the urgency of standardization.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Lambdas in such cases require workarounds, such as abandoning logical const correctness, abandoning ownership, or introducing intermediary {non-}const-propagating types.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): There seems to be a commonly shared feeling that there is a simpler language hiding in C++, and that the lambda syntax should be orthogonal to all the other ways of declaring callable types, not a microcosm unto itself.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Capturing by `const` reference is nonetheless useful – for read-only access to an object too large to copy – and today requires `std::cref` or `std::as_const`, which is not as concise, intuitive, or discoverable as `const&`.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): We are not proposing a new model of lambdas; we are completing one the language has converged on since C++11 – letting the programmer spell the `const` and `mutable` members the desugared function object could always have held.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): There seems to be a commonly shared feeling that there is a simpler language hiding in C++, and that the lambda syntax should be orthogonal to all the other ways of declaring callable types, not a microcosm unto itself.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 36 passes): `std::move_only_function` (P0288, C++23), and since then `std::copyable_function` (P2548) and `std::function_ref` (P0792) in C++26, improved on `std::function` by respecting the `const` qualifier on their call signature
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): The alternative is to simply leave otherwise const captures modifiable, or to use `std::cref`.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): P3963 (approved by EWG) restores it for ordinary captures; a const capture then correctly opts back out – exactly as a `const` member of a hand-written callable would.

candidate 2 (found by 1 of 36 passes): Taken together, this means the above standard types, and *any* other const-correct callable library, *cannot* work with logically const lambdas in the current form.

candidate 2 (found by 2 of 36 passes): The alternative is to simply leave otherwise const captures modifiable, or to use `std::cref`. The former is less safe, and the latter may be undesirable because the lambda does not own the object referred to, which may create lifetime issues.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 36 passes): Avoiding use of wrappers also makes lambda captures smaller and thus easier to read and reason about.
