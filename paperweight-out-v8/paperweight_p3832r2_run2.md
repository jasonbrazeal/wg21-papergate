Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers only partial support for its own standardization, with the strongest evidence being a reference implementation and some acknowledgment of existing practice. The case is thinnest where it matters most: the paper does not establish why this belongs in the standard rather than in a library, nor does it address coordination or interoperability concerns.

- The paper establishes implementation experience through a publicly available reference implementation.
- The paper establishes that users currently hand-roll deadlock-avoidance algorithms and that existing `std::lock` implementations use similar techniques.
- The paper claims but does not establish who is affected or why the problem matters enough to warrant standardization.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any argument for why the standard, rather than a library, is the right home for this facility.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Users who require timeout-based locking of multiple mutexes must implement their own deadlock-avoidance algorithm, typically via `try_lock()`, `unlock()`, and retry. This is error-prone, verbose, and inconsistent with the existing standard library facilities.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Users who require timeout-based locking of multiple mutexes must implement their own deadlock-avoidance algorithm, typically via `try_lock()`, `unlock()`, and retry.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Contrary to `std::lock` / `std::try_lock`, the proposed algorithms accept zero or more lockables.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Existing implementations of `std::lock` already use a deadlock-avoidance algorithm.
