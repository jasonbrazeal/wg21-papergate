Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers meaningful support in a few areas, particularly in showing that the problem is real and that the proposed fix has been implemented and used in practice. However, it leaves the standardization case largely unbuilt: it does not establish who is affected, why this cannot be handled as a library, or how the change would fit with the rest of the standard.

- The strongest support is implementation experience, with two largely independent implementations and no reported bugs.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives by pointing to earlier proposals and identifying concrete problems with the current customization mechanism.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established case for why the standard is the right place for this fix, rather than a library solution.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Unfortunately, there are gaps in its proposed resolution.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Many senders do not know where they will complete until they know where they will be started.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This would leave users with no easy standard way to start work on a given execution context, or transition to another execution context, or to execute work in parallel, or to wait for work to finish.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): As described in Fix algorithm customization now, so-called “early” customization, which determines the return type of `then(sndr, fn)` for example, is irreparably broken.
