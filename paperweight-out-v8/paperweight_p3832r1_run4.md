Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers some useful groundwork, particularly in identifying the absence of a timed multi-lock facility and providing a reference implementation, but it does not sufficiently develop the case that this belongs in the standard. The support is thinnest around why standardization is necessary at all, since the paper leans on the same brief claim about user burden without showing that existing library-level solutions are inadequate or that the problem is widespread enough to justify committee action.

- The strongest support comes from the reference implementation, which demonstrates that the proposed algorithms are at least implementable in practice.
- The discussion of prior art credibly establishes that current standard facilities cover non-timed multi-locking but leave timed multi-locking unaddressed.
- The paper repeatedly asserts that affected users must write their own error-prone code, but it never substantiates who those users are or how common the need is.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any argument for why this cannot be handled adequately by a library outside the standard.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Users who require timeout-based locking of multiple mutexes must implement their own deadlock-avoidance algorithm, typically via `try_lock()`, `unlock()`, and retry. This is error-prone, verbose, and inconsistent with the existing standard library facilities.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Contrary to `std::lock` / `std::try_lock`, the proposed algorithms accept zero or more lockables.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Existing implementations of `std::lock` already use a deadlock-avoidance algorithm.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 30 passes): These algorithms support *BasicLockable* and *Lockable* objects, but there is currently no facility for timed acquisition of multiple *TimedLockable* objects.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 30 passes): These extend the `std::lock` family of functions to timed lockables, enabling consistent and safe use of multiple timed mutexes.
