Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow foundation for its case: it observes a real parallel between `span` and `string_view`, but leaves most of the standardization rationale unstated. The thinnest areas are the absence of any discussion of affected users, why a library solution would be insufficient, or any implementation experience.

- The strongest support is the recognition that `span` and `string_view` are both non-owning views over contiguous memory, making the missing `first` and `last` on `string_view` a plausible consistency gap.
- The paper gestures at coordination and interoperability by arguing there is little reason for the two types not to share shrinking APIs, but it does not develop that into a concrete standardization need.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any implementation experience, which leaves the proposal without evidence that the change is practical or already exercised in real code.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Whilst there is good reason for both of them to exist, there is little to no reason for them not providing the same APIs for shrinking the referenced memory region.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): `first` and `last` are missing for no apparent reason.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Both `span` and `string_view` model non-owning references into contiguous memory.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Whilst `subspan` is conceptually already provided in the form of `string_view::subview`, `first` and `last` are missing for no apparent reason.
