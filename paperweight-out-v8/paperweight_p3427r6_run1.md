Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper’s strongest support comes from its production history in Folly, which grounds both the importance of the feature and its implementation experience. Beyond that, the case for standardization rests largely on assertions about performance and usability that are stated but not demonstrated with evidence, leaving several core questions about affected users, interoperability, and the need for a standard library facility rather than a library solution largely unanswered.

- The paper clearly establishes why synchronous reclamation matters and that object cohorts have been used in production since 2018.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is adequately supported by comparison with the existing hazard pointer interface and the drawbacks of global cleanup.
- The paper claims but does not establish who is affected or why a standard library facility is necessary, since the feature already exists and is widely used in Folly.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any substantive discussion of coordination and interoperability with existing or proposed reclamation facilities.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This paper proposes supporting object cohorts due to the importance of synchronous reclamation for general purpose usability.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Object cohorts have been part of the Folly open-source library (under the name `hazptr_obj_cohort`) and in heavy use in production since 2018.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): While its guarantees are weaker and less flexible than global cleanup, its efficiency enables users to use it in performance sensitive cases where the cost of global cleanup may be impractical.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Doing so avoids burdening the current thread with potentially performing amortized reclamation of tens of thousands of possibly unrelated retired objects, because calling `retire` may trigger amortized asynchronous reclamation.
