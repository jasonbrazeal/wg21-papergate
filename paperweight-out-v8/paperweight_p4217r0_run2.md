Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a narrow justification for changing the status quo: it identifies a real hang in a specific composition and argues that the current ban creates a special case for generic code. Beyond that, the case for standardization is largely undeveloped, with no demonstrated audience, no account of why the standard is the right venue, and no evidence of implementation or coordination.

- The strongest support is the concrete claim that the current restriction causes a hang in an asynchronous composition involving `when_all()`.
- The paper gestures at prior art by equating the empty case with `just()`, but does not establish that this equivalence is accepted or sufficient.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any implementation experience, leaving the proposal without evidence that the change is practical or tested.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): If this restriction were not present the asynchronous operation which results from connecting the result of `std::execution::when_all()` and starting the operation state yielded thereby would hang
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 18 passes): Banning `std::execution::when_all()` (i.e. the status quo) unnecessarily creates a special case when writing generic algorithms.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): it is simply equivalent to `std::execution::just()`.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 18 passes): The standard currently specifies, by fiat, that `std::execution::when_all()` is ill-formed (§33.9.12.12 [exec.when.all])
