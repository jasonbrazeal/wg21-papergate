Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers some grounding for its standardization case through a concrete implementation and a clear statement of the problem, but it leaves most of the surrounding justification undeveloped. The thinnest areas concern who is actually affected, why standardization rather than a library is necessary, and how the feature would coordinate with existing or forthcoming reflection facilities.

- The strongest support is the demonstrated implementation experience, including a sample built on P2996 metafunctions and a Clang fork.
- The paper clearly establishes why the ability to query structural types matters for users and library implementers.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is present but does not fully establish that the proposed approach is the right or necessary path.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established case for why this needs to be in the standard rather than provided as a library, along with no account of who is affected or how it interoperates with related work.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The *is_structural_type check* is valuable wherever values (including small user-defined structs) have to be treated as compile‑time constants, since NTTPs must be structural types.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996, such as *is_constexpr(info),* *is_literal_type(info)* and *is_lambda_closure_type(info).*
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): yet there is no way to query whether a type is structural
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): yet there is no way to query whether a type is structural. Library mandates clauses mean that library implementers must somehow have this functionality, but it is simply not exposed to users.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): We provide a sample implementation using other reflection metafunctions from P2996 to demonstrate how far we can go with the existing batch of reflection type queries included in C++26.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): [P2996](http://wg21.link/P2996) introduced several metafunctions *(consteval* functions that operate on *meta::info)* in *<meta>* that mirror existing type traits, such as *is_const_type(info), is_volatile_type(info),* and *is_trivially_copyable_type(info).*
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): The approach of using reflection metafunctions to query type attributes appears promising, and likely to yield richer APIs than possible with prior techniques.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996, such as *is_constexpr(info),* *is_literal_type(info)* and *is_lambda_closure_type(info).*
