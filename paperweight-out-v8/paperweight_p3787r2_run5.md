Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a narrow, largely asserted rationale for its change, leaning on precedent rather than building a case from affected users, implementation experience, or standardization necessity. Its support is thinnest where it should be most concrete: there is no demonstration of who benefits, what alternatives were weighed beyond similar fixes, or why the library cannot address the gap.

- The strongest support is the reference to P2248R8 and the similar P3217R0 fix, which at least frames the proposal as a consistency correction within an established direction.
- The paper claims the omission matters because `std::uninitialized_fill` was accidentally left out, but it does not show practical consequences for users.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is asserted rather than analyzed, with no comparison of options beyond following the earlier pattern.
- The most glaring omission is the complete absence of evidence about affected users, implementation experience, or why standardization is required rather than a library-level workaround.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Due to an oversight, the `std::uninitialized_fill` family of algorithms was excluded from the ones where a defaulted template parameter was added.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): We extend the same changes that [P2248R8] applied to the rest of the find algorithms to `std(::ranges)::uninitialized_fill`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): In the Tokyo 2024 meeting [P2248R8] (Enabling list-initialization for algorithms) was adopted.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): [P3217R0] was also submitted as a similar fix for `find_last`. That proposal did **not** bump the feature-test macro, as it was considered a "hotfix".
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): [P3217R0] was also submitted as a similar fix for `find_last`.
