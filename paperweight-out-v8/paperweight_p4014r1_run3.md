Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers uneven support for its own standardization, with the strongest material concentrated in implementation experience and engagement with prior art, while the case for why the standard library is the right home remains largely undeveloped. The thinnest areas are the absence of any identified affected audience and the lack of a sustained argument that a library solution would be insufficient.

- The paper’s grounding in existing implementations and its explicit connection to prior sender/receiver and coroutine work give it a credible technical lineage.
- Its discussion of monadic structure and related proposals shows real engagement with the surrounding design space.
- The claim that every developer and codebase would share the same vocabulary is asserted without evidence about who is actually affected or how adoption would occur.
- The paper never establishes why this cannot remain a library, nor why standardization is necessary at all.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 60 passes): Regular C++ has no dedicated cancellation channel; the three-channel model is one of the properties the Sub-Language adds.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 60 passes): The most natural operation in the Sub-Language: take what came before, apply a function, and carry the result forward.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 60 passes): A pipeline sometimes needs to ask its surroundings a question - what scheduler am I running on, what allocator should I use, has anyone asked me to stop?
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 60 passes): These algorithms give C++ something its statements alone cannot express - concurrent execution with structured lifetime guarantees.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 60 passes): The final sections cover the `task` coroutine type ([P3552R3](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3552r3.html), "Add a Coroutine Task Type")[2] and the composition patterns that emerge when senders and coroutines interleave.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 60 passes): In the Sender Sub-Language, `just(x)` is monadic return and `let_value(f)` is monadic bind. `then(f)` is the functor lift - `fmap` - a specialization where the function returns a plain value rather than a new sender.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 60 passes): In Moggi's framework[6], `sync_wait` is the counit - the elimination form that collapses the monadic layer back to a plain value.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 60 passes): These are the functorial action on morphisms[6] - Moggi's `fmap`, the lifting T(f) : T(A) -> T(B) for a function f : A -> B.
