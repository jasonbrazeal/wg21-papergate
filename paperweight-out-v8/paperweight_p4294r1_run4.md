Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers some support for its own standardization, chiefly by showing that the proposed adaptors mirror existing standard facilities and by providing an implementation, but it leaves most of the case for standardization unargued. The thinnest areas are the absence of any identified affected audience, any reason the work belongs in the standard rather than a library, and any discussion of coordination or interoperability.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, since the author has produced a working version based on libstdc++.
- The paper also establishes why the feature matters by pointing to an obvious gap alongside the existing `views::take` and `views::drop` adaptors.
- Prior art and alternatives are only claimed, not established, because the comparisons and table are presented without enough supporting argument to show the proposal’s place among them.
- The most glaring omission is the complete lack of discussion of who is affected, why the standard is the right home, or how the feature would coordinate with existing library practice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): They mirror the shape of the existing `views::take` / `views::drop` adaptors and fill an obvious gap in the standard range adaptor set.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): There is currently no direct adaptor that operates on the *suffix* of a range.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 30 passes): The non-sized cases are what we're truly interested in
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 30 passes): The non-sized cases are what we're truly interested in; and the views class would require:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): They mirror the shape of the existing `views::take` / `views::drop` adaptors and fill an obvious gap in the standard range adaptor set.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): C++20 introduced `views::take` and `views::drop` to select or discard a *prefix* of a range.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 30 passes): | Library / Language | take last n elements | drop last n elements |
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 30 passes): For input range that is already `sized_range`, we can essentially use `views::drop`/`views::take` to make *hypothetical* `take_last_view` and `drop_last_view`.
