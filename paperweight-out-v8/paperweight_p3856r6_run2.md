Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers genuine support in a few narrow areas, particularly by demonstrating an implementation and articulating why the trait would be useful, but it leaves most of the case for standardization largely unargued. The thinnest parts concern who is actually affected, why existing library mechanisms cannot suffice, and how the proposal would coordinate with related standardization efforts.

- The strongest support is the working implementation experience, which shows the trait can be built with existing reflection facilities and gives the proposal a concrete technical anchor.
- The paper clearly establishes why the trait matters by connecting it to structural-type requirements for non-type template parameters and the absence of any current query mechanism.
- The discussion of prior art gestures toward comparing traditional type traits with reflection metafunctions, but it does not actually establish that the proposed approach is necessary or superior.
- The most glaring omission is the failure to establish who is affected or why a library-only solution would not meet their needs, leaving the standardization rationale largely unsupported.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The *is_structural_type check* is valuable wherever values (including small user-defined structs) have to be treated as compile‑time constants, since NTTPs must be structural types.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): yet there is no way to query whether a type is structural.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): yet there is no way to query whether a type is structural

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): In addition, we compare the approaches of using traditional type traits vs. using reflection metafunctions to query type attributes.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996, such as *is_constexpr(info),* *is_literal_type(info)* and *is_lambda_closure_type(info).*
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): The approach of using reflection metafunctions to query type attributes appears promising, and likely to yield richer APIs than possible with prior techniques.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): We provide a sample implementation using other reflection metafunctions from P2996 to demonstrate how far we can go with the existing batch of reflection type queries included in C++26.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The code below shows a possible implementation of *is_structural_type,* using Bloomberg’s Clang fork.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Our experience in implementing new reflection metafunctions shows how reflection type queries can be implemented using other reflection metafunctions only (no intrinsics or SFINAE).
