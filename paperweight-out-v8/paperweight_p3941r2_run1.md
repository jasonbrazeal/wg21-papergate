Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers some grounding for its motivation and shows awareness of prior discussion, but it leaves most of the case for standardization unstated, particularly around who is affected and why the work belongs in the standard rather than in a library.

- The strongest support is the paper’s connection of its motivation to recorded concerns about `affine_on` and the acknowledged problems with the earlier `continues_on` approach.
- The paper also establishes that it is responding to prior art, including the discontinued P3718R0 and existing library practice.
- The thinnest support is the absence of any established need for standardization itself, with no case made for affected users, standard placement, coordination, or why a library solution would be insufficient.
- The only implementation experience offered is a passing claim about one existing library, without enough detail to count as established evidence.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): There were multiple concerns raised against the specification of `affine_on` and discussed as part of [P3796R1](https://wg21.link/P3796R1).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The discussion on `affine_on` revealed some aspects which were not quite clear previously and taking these into account points towards a better design than was previously specified:
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 15 passes): The original proposal for `task` used `continues_on` to schedule the work back on the original scheduler.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 15 passes): It turns out that this use is somewhat problematic in two ways:

candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): [P3718R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3718r0.html) is, however, discontinued (for unrelated reasons) and adding the guarantee to get the current scheduler from a receiver query is proposed here.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The original proposal for `task` used `continues_on` to schedule the work back on the original scheduler.
