Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers only a narrow foundation for its standardization case, centered on how prior discussion of `affine_on` motivates a revised design. That support is thinnest around the practical and institutional questions: who is affected, why this belongs in the standard rather than a library, how it interoperates with existing facilities, and whether anyone has actually implemented it.

- The strongest support is the paper’s connection to earlier concerns about `affine_on`, which grounds its motivation in recorded committee discussion and prior art.
- The paper also establishes that the revised behavior is compatible with earlier design directions rather than contradicting them.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any implementation experience, leaving the proposal without evidence that the design works in practice.
- Equally unaddressed are the affected audience, the need for standardization rather than a library solution, and coordination with existing or adjacent facilities.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): There were multiple concerns raised against the specification of `affine_on` and discussed as part of [P3796R1](https://wg21.link/P3796R1).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The discussion on `affine_on` revealed some aspects which were not quite clear previously and taking these into account points towards a better design than was previously specified:
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 15 passes): The original proposal for `task` used `continues_on` to schedule the work back on the original scheduler.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 15 passes): Changing the scheduler affects the coroutine until the end of the coroutine or until `change_coroutine_scheduler` is `co_await`ed again.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): There were multiple concerns raised against the specification of `affine_on` and discussed as part of [P3796R1](https://wg21.link/P3796R1).
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 15 passes): None of these changes really contradict any earlier design: the shape and behaviour of the `affine_on` algorithm wasn’t fully fleshed out.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 15 passes): with this guarantee in place, `affine_on` only needs one parameter, i.e., the sender for the work to be executed.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 15 passes): This behaviour is similar to `continues_on` but is subtly different with respect to when the scheduling operation state needs to be created and that any stop token from the receiver doesn’t get forwarded.
