Verdict: Weak to Adequate (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow, largely asserted case for standardization: it gestures at the value of querying structural types and at implementation experience, but leaves most of the burden—who is affected, why a library cannot suffice, coordination with existing work, and demonstrated need for a standard facility—essentially unaddressed. The support is thinnest around the absence of any concrete user constituency or interoperability analysis, which makes the standardization rationale feel more like a wish list than a demonstrated gap.

- The strongest support is the claim that library mandates imply implementers already need this functionality internally, even if it is not exposed to users.
- The paper also offers some claimed implementation experience by sketching a sample implementation using existing P2996 reflection metafunctions.
- A notable omission is any identification of who is affected by the lack of a standard query for structural types.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any argument for why a library solution would not be sufficient, leaving the central standardization question unanswered.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The *is_structural_type check* is valuable wherever values (including small user-defined structs) have to be treated as compile‑time constants, since NTTPs must be structural types.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): yet there is no way to query whether a type is structural.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): yet there is no way to query whether a type is structural

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996, such as *is_constexpr(info),* *is_literal_type(info)* and *is_lambda_closure_type(info).*
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): We provide a sample implementation using other reflection metafunctions from P2996 to demonstrate how far we can go with the existing batch of reflection type queries included in C++26.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): In addition, we compare the approaches of using traditional type traits vs. using reflection metafunctions to query type attributes.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): [P2996](http://wg21.link/P2996) introduced several metafunctions *(consteval* functions that operate on *meta::info)* in *<meta>* that mirror existing type traits, such as *is_const_type(info), is_volatile_type(info),* and *is_trivially_copyable_type(info).*
