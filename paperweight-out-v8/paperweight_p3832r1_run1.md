Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers a narrow but real foundation for its standardization case: it can point to existing standard-library precedent and a reference implementation, but most of the affirmative argument rests on repeated assertions about user burden rather than demonstrated need. The thinnest areas are interoperability and the distinction between what a library can provide and what requires language or standard-library specification.

- The strongest support comes from prior art, since the paper credibly ties its proposal to the established pattern of `std::lock` and `std::try_lock`.
- Implementation experience is also established through the availability of a reference implementation.
- The case for why this belongs in the standard is largely asserted rather than shown, relying on the same general claim about error-prone user code without concrete evidence.
- The most glaring omission is coordination and interoperability, where the paper offers nothing to show how the facility would interact with existing or future locking abstractions.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Users who require timeout-based locking of multiple mutexes must implement their own deadlock-avoidance algorithm, typically via `try_lock()`, `unlock()`, and retry. This is error-prone, verbose, and inconsistent with the existing standard library facilities.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): C++11 introduced `std::lock` and `std::try_lock` (and C++17 introduced `std::scoped_lock`) to simplify deadlock-free acquisition of multiple lockables.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Consistent with `std::lock` and `std::try_lock`.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Existing implementations of `std::lock` already use a deadlock-avoidance algorithm.
