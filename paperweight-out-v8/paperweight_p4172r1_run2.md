Verdict: Excellent (13/14)

The paper offers substantial support for its own standardization, with nearly every required element backed by concrete evidence from production use, historical precedent, and direct comparison to alternatives. The support is thinnest where the paper relies on broad claims about ecosystem behavior rather than specific, reproducible data, though even those claims are grounded in two decades of observable practice.

- The strongest support comes from implementation experience, where the paper points to unchanged production APIs in Boost.Asio and working code in Corosio and Capy.
- The case for why a library will not do is well established through documented template explosion, binary bloat, and ABI instability in Boost.Asio and Boost.Beast.
- The paper establishes prior art and alternatives clearly by explaining why coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary rather than competing, and why the `allocator_arg_t` alternative imposes unacceptable forwarding costs.
- The most glaring omission is any direct evidence quantifying the claimed incompatibility across networking libraries beyond the assertion that they cannot compose.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 57 passes): Without that waist, every stack reinvents incompatible task types and environments; an HTTP layer on one model does not compose with storage or RPC on another.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 57 passes): The `allocator_arg_t` alternative (Section 8.1) would require every handler to carry the allocator and forward it at every `co_await`.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 57 passes): The absence of a standard frame allocator propagation mechanism forces either `allocator_arg_t` signature pollution or reliance on `shared_ptr` for lifetime management.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 57 passes): The *IoAwaitable* approach - one template parameter, environment propagated through `io_env` - avoids this structural barrier.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 57 passes): This paper is the companion record: why each facility exists, what alternatives were considered, how each choice was forced by the constraints of the domain, and where the historical evidence lives.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 57 passes): Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary. Each serves the domain where its design choices pay off.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 57 passes): The *IoAwaitable* model uses `std::stop_token` directly with bounded, forward-only propagation, avoiding this cost.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 57 passes): The `allocator_arg_t` alternative (Section 8.1) would require every handler to carry the allocator and forward it at every `co_await`.

candidate 2 (found by 3 of 57 passes): The two-argument signature with `io_env const*` ensures that a coroutine from a different model (one whose `await_transform` does not inject `io_env`) fails to compile.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 57 passes): The protocol chooses the other side of the fork: type-erase the executor through `executor_ref`, keep `task<T>` at one template parameter, and accept one vtable indirection per `dispatch`/`post` call.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 57 passes): Without a shared protocol, each library is an island.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 57 passes): a second template parameter on the task type creates cross-library interoperability problems, prevents separate compilation, and destroys ABI stability.

candidate 3 (found by 2 of 57 passes): Each networking library builds on a different async model, so they cannot compose.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 57 passes): The two-argument `await_suspend` is the protocol boundary. The caller's `await_transform` injects the environment as a pointer parameter.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 57 passes): The service model, the shutdown ordering, and the `use_service`/`make_service` API have remained unchanged through over a decade of production use in Boost.Asio.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 57 passes): The recycling allocator is not proposed for standardisation - the choice of frame allocation strategy is a quality-of-implementation concern.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 57 passes): [Corosio](https://github.com/cppalliance/corosio) [4] implements these concepts in production-ready code.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 57 passes): The implementation is from the [Capy](https://github.com/cppalliance/capy) [3] library.
