Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper offers a solid core motivation by tying the change to two open issues and showing that the current rules produce ill-formed or crashing behavior, but it leaves several practical and procedural questions only asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest support concerns implementation experience and the absence of a library-only workaround, both of which are mentioned but not backed by evidence or detail.

- The strongest support is the direct connection to CWG 3003 and LWG 4381, with a clear statement that no library wording fix is possible without a core language change.
- The paper also establishes relevant prior art by citing P0552R0 and P0091R3, and by noting that current implementations already accept most examples under simple substitution semantics.
- The weakest established area is implementation experience, since the claim that all current implementations accept the feature is repeated but not substantiated with version or vendor specifics.
- The most glaring omission is the failure to establish why a library-only solution will not do, despite the paper’s own reliance on that claim for its standardization rationale.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): addressing both CWG 3003 and LWG 4381.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Both cases would currently be ill-formed due to the current rules for CTAD for alias templates
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): There is no known fix for the library wording without changes to the core language, see LWG 4381.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 33 passes): This currently crashes most implementations, but as the *defining-type-id* of Alias doesn’t denote a deducible template, it should just be ill-formed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): But since [P0552R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0522r0.html) "DR: Matching of template template-arguments excludes compatible templates", a template template argument doesn’t have to match a template template parameter exactly; the template template parameter just needs to be more specialized than the template template argument.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Current implementations accept the above examples (except for the last one) with the "simple substitution" semantics.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): addressing both CWG 3003 and LWG 4381.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 33 passes): it was pointed out that it was not the design intent of P0091R3 "Template argument deduction for class templates (Rev. 6)" to disallow CTAD for template template parameters.
