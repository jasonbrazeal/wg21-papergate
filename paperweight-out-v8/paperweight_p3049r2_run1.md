Verdict: Adequate to Strong (6/14)

The paper offers a solid foundation in some areas, particularly by grounding its design in implementation experience and by engaging with prior art and alternatives, but it leaves several essential parts of its standardization case unproven or entirely unaddressed. The thinnest support concerns the affected audience, the insufficiency of a library-only solution, and the portability or interoperability claims that would justify a standard facility.

- The strongest support comes from the existence of a working implementation and the paper’s acknowledgment of divergent implementation strategies in major standard libraries.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is credibly established, including the paper’s explicit reasoning for departing from traditional splice-based APIs and its handling of iterator requirements.
- The claim that a dedicated `node-handle` is necessary for portable code is asserted but not backed by evidence or examples of portability failures.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established description of who is affected or why a library-only approach cannot meet their needs.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): As we can’t come up with a convincing use-case for such a facility, we don’t propose them and suggest future proposals on this topic to introduce a dedicated `multi-node-handle` instead of changing the conceptual design of `node-handle`.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 30 passes): Separation of extraction and insertion (compared to the traditional splice-API), thereby enabling: Modifications of the otherwise immutable key.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): We agree with the criticism that there is a lack of consistency with other node-based sequences, but think the advantages of this new API are very clear:
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 30 passes): As only forward iterators are required, there is sufficient leeway for implementation divergence: MS-STL uses doubly-linked bucket lists whereas libstdc++ uses a singly-linked ones.
