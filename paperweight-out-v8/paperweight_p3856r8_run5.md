Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper makes a narrow but genuine start by explaining why a structural-type query would be useful, but it leaves most of the burden of justification unaddressed. The strongest material concerns motivation and the existence of a sample implementation, while the case for affected users, prior art, standardization need, interoperability, and why a library solution is insufficient remains largely asserted or absent.

- The paper clearly establishes that querying whether a type is structural matters for compile-time programming and NTTP constraints.
- It offers some implementation evidence through a sample built on P2996 reflection facilities and a Clang fork.
- It asserts, but does not demonstrate, that existing library mandates imply the functionality must already exist inside implementations.
- It does not identify who is affected, why a library cannot suffice, or how the feature would coordinate with other standardization work.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): yet there is no way to query whether a type is structural.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The *is_structural_type check* is valuable wherever values (including small user-defined structs) have to be treated as compile‑time constants, since NTTPs must be structural types.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): We provide a sample implementation using other reflection metafunctions from P2996 to demonstrate how far we can go with the existing batch of reflection type queries included in C++26.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996, such as *is_constexpr(info),* *is_literal_type(info)* and *is_lambda_closure_type(info).*
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): [P2996](http://wg21.link/P2996) introduced several metafunctions *(consteval* functions that operate on *meta::info)* in *<meta>* that mirror existing type traits, such as *is_const_type(info), is_volatile_type(info),* and *is_trivially_copyable_type(info).*

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 21 passes): Library mandates clauses mean that library implementers must somehow have this functionality, but it is simply not exposed to users.

candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Our experience in implementing new reflection metafunctions shows how reflection type queries can be implemented using other reflection metafunctions only (no intrinsics or SFINAE).
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): The code below shows a possible implementation of *is_structural_type,* using Bloomberg’s Clang fork.
