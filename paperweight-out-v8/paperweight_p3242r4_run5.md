Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper gives a reasonably clear account of why a general `mdspan` copy operation would matter and why existing standard facilities do not cover it, but it leaves several practical justifications more asserted than demonstrated. The strongest material concerns the need for standard support and the absence of suitable iterators or ranges, while the thinnest concerns who is actually affected and whether a library solution would be inadequate.

- The paper establishes that copying between `mdspan`s with complex layouts is difficult without standard library support, and that existing facilities are insufficient.
- It also establishes relevant prior art by distinguishing the proposal from `std::linalg::copy` and by situating it against C++23 `mdspan`.
- The paper claims but does not establish that a library solution would not suffice, since the absence of iterators or ranges is asserted rather than shown to be a fundamental barrier.
- The most glaring omission is any identification of the affected user community, leaving the scope and urgency of the problem largely unspecified.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): However, without standard library support, copying efficiently between `mdspan`s with mixes of complex layouts is challenging for users.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): This paper is proposing a version of `copy` that is not constrained by the number of ranks and differs from `std::linalg::copy` in some important ways outline below.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): For example, if a copy occurs between two `mdspan`s with the same layout mapping type that is contiguous and both use `default_accessor`, the intention is that this could be implemented by a single `memcpy`.

candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): A more constrained form of `copy` is also included in the standard linear algebra library ([P1673R13]). However, existing standard library facilities are not sufficient here.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): C++23 introduced `mdspan` ([P0009R18]), a non-owning multidimensional array abstraction that has a customizable layout.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 21 passes): However, existing standard library facilities are not sufficient here. Currently, `mdspan` does not have iterators or ranges that represent the span of the `mdspan`.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): We settled on `<mdspan>` because as proposed this is a relatively light-weight addition that reflects operations that are commonly desired with `mdspan`s.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): However, existing standard library facilities are not sufficient here.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): This seems like overkill for two functions. However, in the future, we may want to add new algorithms for `mdspan` that are not strictly covered by existing algorithms in `<algorithm>`, so this option may be more future proof.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Many applications, including high-performance computing (HPC), image processing, computer graphics, etc that benefit from `mdspan` also would benefit from basic memory operations provided in standard algorithms such as copy and fill.
