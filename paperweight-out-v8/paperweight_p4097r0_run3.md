Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow, preliminary basis for its standardization case: it gestures at a real limitation in the error channel and cites some committee sentiment, but it does not develop the affected audience, alternatives, need for a standard, interoperability, library feasibility, or implementation experience. The support is thinnest where the proposal should connect its technical observation to a concrete standardization need.

- The strongest support is the repeated identification of a possible information-loss problem when compound I/O results must use the single-argument `set_error` channel.
- The paper also records some committee agreement that sender/receiver is a promising basis for asynchronous use cases, though it does not show how that agreement translates into a need for this proposal.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established case for why the problem requires standardization rather than a library solution, or how the proposed facility would coordinate with existing and in-flight specifications.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 30 passes): "some of the error cases may have been partial successes. In that case, using the set_error channel taking just one argument is somewhat limiting."
