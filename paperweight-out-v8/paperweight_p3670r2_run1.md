Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a narrow slice of the case needed for standardization: it shows some awareness of related proposals and existing implementations, but it leaves the motivating problem, affected users, and need for a standard facility largely unstated. The support is thinnest around the basic rationale for why this work belongs in the standard at all.

- The strongest support is the paper’s engagement with prior art, including related proposals and the presumption of CWG3027.
- The paper claims implementation experience through P2662R3 in Clang and GCC, but does not establish experience with the feature it actually proposes.
- The paper does not establish who is affected or why the problem matters, leaving the core motivation undeveloped.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any argument for why a library solution would not suffice or why standardization is necessary.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): It turns out that [P2841R7](https://wg21.link/P2841R7) [3] has no impact on the design of this paper except that indexing a pack of concept template parameter just works - and [P2989R2](https://wg21.link/P2989R2) [2] was not approved for C++26.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): The syntax for indexing a pack of template-name is similar to the syntax to the syntax used to index a pack of types or expressions.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 30 passes): Both the black and green text below presumes that CWG3027 [1] has been approved and applied
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 30 passes): Both the black and green text below presumes that CWG3027 has been approved and applied
