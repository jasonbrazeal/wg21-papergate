Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper gives a partial account of why the feature would be useful and points to an existing precedent, but it leaves several essential parts of the standardization case unaddressed, especially around affected users, the need for a standard facility, and practical implementation experience.

- The clearest support is the motivation: the paper explains that retrieving a raw pointer from `optional<T&>` or `optional<T>` is not straightforward and that this matters when interfacing with C or legacy C++ APIs.
- The paper also establishes a reasonable prior-art basis by following Boost.Optional’s existing choice.
- The thinnest areas are the absence of any established discussion of who is affected, why a standard facility is needed rather than a library solution, and why the standard should take this on.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of established implementation experience, since the only supporting statement is a claim about following Boost.Optional rather than evidence from actual use or implementation.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): There is no easy, obvious way to retrieve the pointer stored in an `optional<T&>` , nor a pointer to the object in an `optional<T>`
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): When calling a C or a legacy C++ API, a raw pointer is often used instead of an `optional<T&>` (in the case of C or pre-C++26 APIs) or an `optional<T>` (in the case of C or pre-C++17 APIs).
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The primary use case, as mentioned, is to use this with C APIs and legacy C++ APIs that use pointers because there is/was (C/C++) no suitable vocabulary type to use.
