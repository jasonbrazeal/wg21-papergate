Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper offers a reasonably grounded account of the practical problem and the affected code, but it leaves several essential parts of the standardization case almost entirely unaddressed. The strongest material concerns real-world usage and the unintended divergence from existing practice, while the thinnest concerns why a standard change is the right remedy and how it fits with adjacent specifications.

- The paper clearly establishes that `#line 0` appears in thousands of real codebases across major implementations, so the affected population is not hypothetical.
- It also establishes that the current wording was an accidental restriction of a previously useful extension point, with C and P2843R3 providing relevant context.
- The paper does not establish why the standard itself must change rather than leaving the behavior to implementations or addressing it through other means.
- It also offers no coordination or interoperability discussion, leaving unclear how the proposed change would interact with C, existing tooling, or other translation-phase requirements.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): The restrictions on `#line` do not match existing practices.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Given that all implementations use different strategies to represent source locations, which have a significant impact on compiler performance, we cannot reasonably mandate widening the requirements.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 30 passes): So the UB that existed in the standard was used as an extension point by implementations, extension point that we accidentally took away, forcing implementations to emit a warning.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 30 passes): This is great because we want to avoid talking about UB during translation. And generally avoid unnecessary UBs. However, it forces an implementation to diagnose on the following directives:
