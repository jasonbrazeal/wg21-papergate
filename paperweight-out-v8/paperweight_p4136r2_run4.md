Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper gives a reasonably concrete account of the practical breakage and the implementation landscape, but it leaves the standardization rationale incomplete where it matters most: it does not show why the standard itself must change, nor how the change would fit with adjacent specifications and existing tooling.

- The strongest support is the evidence that `#line 0` appears in real code and that major implementations already treat the formerly undefined behavior as an extension.
- The paper also establishes that the current wording accidentally narrowed an existing extension point and that widening the requirements is not a viable alternative.
- The case for standardization is asserted mainly through the same implementation-behavior evidence, but the paper does not develop why a normative change is the right remedy.
- The most glaring omissions are the absence of any coordination or interoperability discussion and any explanation of why a library-level or non-standard solution would not suffice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): The restrictions on `#line` do not match existing practices.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): So the UB that existed in the standard was used as an extension point by implementations, extension point that we accidentally took away, forcing implementations to emit a warning.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Given that all implementations use different strategies to represent source locations, which have a significant impact on compiler performance, we cannot reasonably mandate widening the requirements.
