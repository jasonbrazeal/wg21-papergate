Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers a solid conceptual case for why asynchronous functions should be able to complete with references, and it grounds that case in prior art and the recent removal of `std::execution::split`. The support is thinnest, however, around the practical and procedural questions: who is affected, how the feature would interoperate with existing facilities, and why a library solution would be insufficient.

- The strongest support is the paper’s explanation of why reference-returning asynchronous completions matter and how the current `complete` API limits the ownership model.
- The paper also credibly establishes prior art and alternatives by discussing `std::execution::split` and the `std::visit`-style approach.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established discussion of who is affected by the proposed change.
- Equally unaddressed are coordination and interoperability with the broader `std::execution` ecosystem, as well as any demonstration that a library-level solution cannot suffice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Synchronous functions are capable of returning references. This is uncontroversial. Some of the first functions new C++ developers interact with return references (e.g. `std::vector::operator[]`). Therefore it stands to reason that asynchronous functions should have this capability as well.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): While `complete` is convenient as an API it admits only one modality by which the stored completion (if any) can be consumed: Completing an asynchronous operation by sending a completion signal to a receiver.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 33 passes): This should be changed. Not only is there value in the standard mandating consistency here, but there’s also value in reserving syntactic space for operations which truly send rvalue references
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 33 passes): The distinction between a by-value completion and an rvalue-reference completion is not what will be deduced by a generic/forwarding `set_value` member function of the receiver, but rather what the ownership model is for that particular argument to the completion.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Consider the previously-standard [6] algorithm which advertised and sent lvalue references: `std::execution::split` [5].
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 33 passes): It was removed before C++26 shipped [6] (note that the fact `std::execution::split` completed with references meant that it was the asynchronous analogue of a function which returns a reference to a local variable
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): At first mirroring the interface of `std::visit` seems appropriate with no completion represented by `std::monostate`. However this falls apart as we once again consider application of this primitive to `std::execution::when_all`.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 33 passes): As adopted into the C++26 working draft in St. Louis `std::execution` had a single asynchronous algorithm which completed with one or more references. It was removed before C++26 shipped [6]
