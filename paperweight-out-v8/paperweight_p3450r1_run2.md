Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only the beginnings of a case for standardization, resting on the author’s reported experience and a narrow motivating scenario. Its support is thinnest in almost every category that would connect that experience to a need for a standard change: the affected audience, alternatives, interoperability, and the limits of library solutions are all left unaddressed.

- The strongest support is the author’s claim of encountering the same issue while implementing `constexpr std::format` in both `{fmt}` and libstdc++.
- The motivation is framed as a runtime/constant-evaluation discrepancy involving `Base` and `Derived`, but the paper does not establish why this matters beyond the author’s own recent cases.
- The paper does not identify who would be affected by the problem or how widespread it is.
- Most notably, it offers no discussion of prior art, alternatives, why a library cannot solve the problem, or how the proposal would coordinate with existing standard features.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 18 passes): There are is a situation where, during `parse()`, at runtime an object of type `Base` is constructed and used except that, during constant evaluation, an object of type `Derived` is used instead.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 18 passes): I recently ran into cases where a very slight extension of it could make it more useful.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): In attempting to implement `constexpr std::format` [[P3391R0]](https://wg21.link/p3391r0), both within `{fmt}` and libstdc++, I ran into the same issue.
