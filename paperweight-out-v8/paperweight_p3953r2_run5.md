Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow slice of the case for standardization: it explains why the existing name has become misleading, but it does not establish who is affected, why a standard change is necessary, or how the change would fit with existing practice. The strongest support is conceptual, while the practical and procedural groundwork is almost entirely absent.

- The paper clearly establishes that the distinction underlying `std::runtime_format` is no longer about evaluation time, which gives the renaming question a real conceptual basis.
- The discussion of prior art gestures toward relevant history and existing terminology, but it does not demonstrate that the proposed direction is the right one or that alternatives have been seriously weighed.
- The paper never identifies the affected users or code, leaving the actual stakes of the change unstated.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any argument for why this belongs in the standard rather than being handled through library-level or non-normative means.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): As a result, `std::runtime_format` can now be evaluated at compile time, making its name misleading.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): The real distinction is not when formatting occurs, but how the format string is provided and validated.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The real distinction is not when formatting occurs, but how the format string is provided and validated. The term runtime conflates it with evaluation time.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): [P2918] introduced `std::runtime_format` to allow opting out of compile-time format string checks in `std::format`. Subsequently, [P3391] made `std::format` usable in constant evaluation.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The name `std::runtime_format` was accurate when introduced in [P2918], as format strings were not usable in constant evaluation.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): This aligns with existing terminology `std::format` such as dynamic format specifiers (`check_dynamic_spec`).
