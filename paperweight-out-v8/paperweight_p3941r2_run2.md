Verdict: Weak to Adequate (3/14)

The paper offers only partial support for its own standardization, with the strongest material going to prior art and alternatives, while most other necessary justifications are either asserted without evidence or absent entirely. The thinnest areas concern the affected audience, the need for a standard as opposed to a library solution, and coordination with existing practice.

- The paper does establish that the change responds to concerns raised about `affine_on` and that related scheduling approaches have appeared in prior proposals.
- The paper claims the change is important and reflects existing library practice, but it does not substantiate either point with concrete detail or evidence.
- The paper does not identify who is affected by the proposed change or what problem they face in practice.
- The paper offers no argument for why this belongs in the standard rather than in a library, and no discussion of coordination or interoperability with other facilities.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): There were multiple concerns raised against the specification of `affine_on` and discussed as part of [P3796R1](https://wg21.link/P3796R1).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The discussion on `affine_on` revealed some aspects which were not quite clear previously and taking these into account points towards a better design than was previously specified:
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 15 passes): This change is not associated with any national body comment. However, it is still important to do! It isn’t adding any new functionality but removes a problematic way to achieve something which can be better achieved differently.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): There were multiple concerns raised against the specification of `affine_on` and discussed as part of [P3796R1](https://wg21.link/P3796R1).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The original proposal for `task` used `continues_on` to schedule the work back on the original scheduler.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 15 passes): [P3718R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3718r0.html) is, however, discontinued (for unrelated reasons) and adding the guarantee to get the current scheduler from a receiver query is proposed here.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 15 passes): This functionality was originally included because it is present for, at least, one of the existing libraries, although in a form which was recommended against.
