Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers a partial case for its proposal, with the clearest support concentrated in the motivation and the discussion of naming and prior alternatives. The thinnest areas are the absence of any account of who would be affected, how the feature would coordinate with existing practice, why a library solution is insufficient, and whether there is any implementation experience.

- The strongest support is the motivation, which concretely illustrates the verbosity and limitations of current intrinsic-heavy code and explains why configurable chunk sizes would help.
- The paper also establishes some prior art and alternative naming choices by tying the proposed name to existing `std::simd` functions and documenting an earlier indexed-suffix design.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any established case for why this belongs in the standard rather than in a library, since the only credited passage merely repeats the naming alignment without addressing implementability outside the standard.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Proposal to extend `std::simd` with a method of allowing a lambda to be invoked on smaller pieces of a SIMD value in order to make interaction with intrinsics easier.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): However, it is inevitable that the programmer will want to make some use of target-specific intrinsics in order to unlock some of the more unusual features of those specific platforms.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): This is now getting verbose, and it only handles `basic_vec` value inputs which are twice the size of a register value.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 21 passes): Being able to define a different size is useful for two reasons:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The function is named `chunked_invoke` and placed in `std::simd` to directly align with related established functions such as `chunk` and `cat`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The draft standard of `std::simd` recommends that provision is made for conversions to and from implementation defined types.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 21 passes): In the first revision of this paper we proposed that the function which invokes a Callable with an explicit offset should be called with a `_indexed` suffix (e.g., `simd::chunked_invoke_indexed`).
