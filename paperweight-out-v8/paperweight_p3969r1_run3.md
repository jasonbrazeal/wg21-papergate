Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers a narrow but genuine justification for changing `std::bit_cast`, centered on eliminating a form that is effectively always undefined behavior, and it shows some engagement with prior discussion and alternatives. Beyond that core motivation, however, the case for standardization is largely undeveloped: the affected audience, the need for a standard-language change rather than a library facility, and any practical implementation experience are all left unestablished.

- The strongest support is the clear explanation that bit-casting a padded type to a non-padded type currently collapses into unconditional UB, making the proposed ill-formedness a safety improvement rather than a new restriction on valid code.
- The paper also credits prior art and alternatives by acknowledging the earlier two-approach revision and the suggestion to clear padding before bit-casting.
- The thinnest part of the argument is the absence of any established affected-user population or demonstrated real-world impact, leaving the urgency of standardization unclear.
- Most glaringly, the paper does not establish why this requires a core-language change rather than a library solution, nor does it provide implementation experience to support feasibility.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): When bit-casting a type containing padding bits to a type with no padding bits, `std::bit_cast` degenerates into an alternative spelling for `std::unreachable` (some exceptions apply).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): The proposed change only makes the degenerate form of `std::bit_cast` ill-formed, i.e. it raises an error in code that contained unconditional UB.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 30 passes): The single-function solution is problematic because `std::bit_cast` can be used to convert padded types to a byte array without undefined behavior and with zero overhead.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 30 passes): This behavior is a footgun, and is not very useful. If users wanted a function that always has UB, they should be writing `std::unreachable`, not `std::bit_cast`.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): R0 of this paper was more ambitious and presented two approaches:
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): In the discussion of this proposal prior to publication, it was suggested to clear the padding *before* bit-casting. That is, standardizing [`__builtin_clear_padding`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html#index-_005f_005fbuiltin_005fclear_005fpadding) and using an idiom such as:
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 30 passes): Another case where the degenerate form may arise frequently is bit-casting `_BitInt` (supported by Clang as an extension and proposed in [[P3666R3]](https://wg21%2elink/p3666r3))
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 30 passes): Another case where the degenerate form may arise frequently is bit-casting `_BitInt` (supported by Clang as an extension and proposed in [[P3666R3]](https://wg21%2elink/p3666r3)), considering that most `_BitInt` types (at least 7/8) have padding bits.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 30 passes): That makes it possible to implement a proper conversion from `long double` to `__int128`, although it requires multiple steps:
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 30 passes): This would likely mean that `constexpr std::clear_padding` is effectively unimplementable in current compilers.
