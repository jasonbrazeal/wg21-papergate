Verdict: Adequate (7/14)

The paper offers solid evidence that the proposed change has been implemented in real libraries and that it responds to prior design concerns, but it does not make a complete case for standardization because several essential justifications are asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest support concerns why this belongs in the standard rather than in a library, and the paper does not establish that at all.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, with two largely independent implementations and no reported bugs.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives by tracing the issue through earlier proposals and showing agreement from the original critic.
- It claims but does not establish who is affected, relying on implementation and porting statements rather than evidence of broader user impact.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established reason why the standard must adopt this rather than leaving it to libraries.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Unfortunately, there are gaps in its proposed resolution.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This would leave users with no easy standard way to start work on a given execution context, or transition to another execution context, or to execute work in parallel, or to wait for work to finish.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): As described in Fix algorithm customization now, so-called “early” customization, which determines the return type of `then(sndr, fn)` for example, is irreparably broken.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Two important issues with the proposed design were raised at that time, both by Robert Leahy:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): [[P3718R0]](https://wg21.link/p3718r0) is the latest effort to shore up the mechanism.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This fix has been implemented in NVIDIA’s [CCCL](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl) library since mid-September 2025 (see [NVIDIA/cccl#5793](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl/pull/5793)) and in [stdexec](https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec) since late November (see [NVIDIA/stdexec#1683](https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec/pull/1683)).
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 36 passes): It proposes using information from the sender about where it will complete during “early” customization... and it proposes using information from the receiver about where the operation will start during “late” customization.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 36 passes): Robert Leahy agrees that this change addresses his concern.
