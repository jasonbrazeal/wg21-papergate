Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers a narrow but real foundation for its case, chiefly through its discussion of prior art and the relationship between reflection metafunctions and existing type traits, but it leaves most of the burden of justification unaddressed. The argument for why the feature matters gestures at plausible use cases without connecting them to concrete users or code, and the document is largely silent on why standardization—rather than a library or existing reflection facilities—is the right path.

- The strongest support comes from the comparison with P2996 and the demonstration that reflection-based type queries are a promising direction with prior precedent.
- The claim of implementation experience is present but thin, since the sample implementation is only asserted to exist and is not shown to validate the proposal’s feasibility in a general setting.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established need for standardization itself, including who is affected, why the standard is required, and why a library solution would not suffice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): yet there is no way to query whether a type is structural.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The *is_structural_type check* is valuable wherever values (including small user-defined structs) have to be treated as compile‑time constants, since NTTPs must be structural types.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996, such as *is_constexpr(info),* *is_literal_type(info)* and *is_lambda_closure_type(info).*

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): In addition, we compare the approaches of using traditional type traits vs. using reflection metafunctions to query type attributes.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): [P2996](http://wg21.link/P2996) introduced several metafunctions *(consteval* functions that operate on *meta::info)* in *<meta>* that mirror existing type traits, such as *is_const_type(info), is_volatile_type(info),* and *is_trivially_copyable_type(info).*
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996, such as *is_constexpr(info),* *is_literal_type(info)* and *is_lambda_closure_type(info).*
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): The approach of using reflection metafunctions to query type attributes appears promising, and likely to yield richer APIs than possible with prior techniques.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): We provide a sample implementation using other reflection metafunctions from P2996 to demonstrate how far we can go with the existing batch of reflection type queries included in C++26.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Our experience in implementing new reflection metafunctions shows how reflection type queries can be implemented using other reflection metafunctions only (no intrinsics or SFINAE).
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): The code below shows a possible implementation of *is_structural_type,* using Bloomberg’s Clang fork.
