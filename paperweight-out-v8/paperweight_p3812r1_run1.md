Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a thin case for standardization, resting almost entirely on a brief motivation about removing a limitation on defaulted copy assignment. The strongest material is a gesture toward existing lifetime rules and a core guideline, but even that is presented as context rather than developed into a real argument. Most of the necessary groundwork—who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, what alternatives were considered, and whether anyone has tried this—is simply absent.

- The paper at least names the intended benefit: allowing default copy assignment for classes with const or reference members when a default copy constructor exists.
- It gestures toward prior art by citing basic.life and a C++ Core Guideline, though it does not explain how those bear on the proposal.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any implementation experience or evidence that the change is feasible and useful in practice.
- The paper never establishes who is affected or why a library solution cannot address the problem, leaving the standardization need largely unstated.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): Allow compilers to be able to generate the default copy assignment operator for classes that have `const` and `&` members by making the class `transparently replaceable` if it has a default copy constructor.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): Without this functionality, besides being more code, constness has to be enforced via even more code instead of it being enforced by use of the `const` keyword or the constness associated with references.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 15 passes): This features removes a current limitation of default member functions.
