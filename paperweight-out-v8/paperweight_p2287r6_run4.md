Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers only a narrow basis for its own standardization: it can point to real implementation experience, but most of the surrounding case is asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest areas are the absence of any discussion of prior art, alternatives, why a library solution would not suffice, or why the standard itself needs to change.

- The strongest support is implementation experience, with both a longstanding GCC extension and a literal Clang implementation credited.
- The paper claims relevance and user impact through a concrete upgrade break, but does not establish how widespread or representative that breakage is.
- The paper does not establish prior art or alternatives, leaving the design space around the proposal largely unexamined.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any argument for why this belongs in the standard rather than remaining a compiler extension or being addressed through a library facility.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 21 passes): But there is currently no way to designate the base class here.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 21 passes): However, the two do not mix: a designated initializer can currently only refer to a direct non-static data members.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): Which means that my only options for initializing a `B` are to fall-back to regular aggregate initialization and write either `B{{1}, 2}` or `B{1, 2}`. Neither are especially satisfactory.
