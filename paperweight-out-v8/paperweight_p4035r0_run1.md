Verdict: Adequate (7/14)

The paper offers solid support in the areas that matter most for framing the problem: it explains why the type is needed, shows that the standard library already contains the relevant design conventions, and points to real implementation experience in Boost.URL. The case is thinnest around the questions a committee would ask next—how this would coordinate with existing string facilities and why the same result cannot be achieved by a library outside the standard.

- The strongest support is the combination of a clearly articulated design principle and shipped field experience in Boost.URL, including both the validating default and the explicit unsafe escape hatch.
- The paper also establishes that the standard library already has the naming convention and constrained-default pattern, even if the existing convention got the naming backwards.
- The demand evidence from GitHub is suggestive but not enough on its own to establish who is affected or how widespread the need really is.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any discussion of coordination and interoperability with existing standard string types and APIs.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): C++ should make the safe thing easy, and the unsafe thing possible.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 18 passes): The type fills a real gap: `std::string` owns and null-terminates, `std::string_view` does not own and does not null-terminate, and `cstring_view` does not own but does null-terminate.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 18 passes): The evidence documents a recurring design value: safe by default, with explicit escape hatches where zero-cost composition requires them.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): Boost.URL has shipped this pattern with years of field experience: a validating default (`pct_string_view`[5]) and an escape hatch (`make_pct_string_view_unsafe`[5]) for trusted boundaries.

  [6] References                                   0/0/0  -> 0.00
candidate 1 (found by 2 of 18 passes): Eliminating the escape hatch does not eliminate unstructured concurrency; it pushes programmers toward worse tools.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 18 passes): The standard library already provides constrained defaults with explicit broader counterparts.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 18 passes): The standard library already has the naming convention. It got it backwards because the principle was not articulated at the time.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 18 passes): The evidence documents a recurring design value: safe by default, with explicit escape hatches where zero-cost composition requires them.
