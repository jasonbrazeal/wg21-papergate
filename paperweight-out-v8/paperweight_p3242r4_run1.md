Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers a narrow but genuine foundation for its standardization case, centered on the difficulty of efficient copying between `mdspan`s and the existence of a related but insufficient facility in the linear algebra library. Beyond that, the argument is largely asserted rather than demonstrated: the affected audience, the need for a standard rather than a library solution, and the practical experience behind the proposal are all left thin.

- The strongest support is the clear statement that efficient copying between `mdspan`s with complex layout mixes is challenging without standard library support.
- The paper also establishes prior art by pointing to the constrained `std::linalg::copy` and explaining why it is not sufficient here.
- The thinnest part of the case is the absence of any established description of who is affected by the problem.
- The claims about why a standard facility is needed and why a library cannot suffice rest on repeated assertions about missing iterators and ranges, without being substantiated.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): However, without standard library support, copying efficiently between `mdspan`s with mixes of complex layouts is challenging for users.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): For example, if a copy occurs between two `mdspan`s with the same layout mapping type that is contiguous and both use `default_accessor`, the intention is that this could be implemented by a single `memcpy`.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): A more constrained form of `copy` is also included in the standard linear algebra library ([P1673R13]). However, existing standard library facilities are not sufficient here.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): This paper is proposing a version of `copy` that is not constrained by the number of ranks and differs from `std::linalg::copy` in some important ways outline below.
