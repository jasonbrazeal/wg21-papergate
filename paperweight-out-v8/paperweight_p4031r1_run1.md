Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a narrow, undeveloped argument about naming confusion, and it does not build a case that standardization is necessary or even clearly motivated. The support is thinnest around the basic questions of who would be affected, why a library solution would not suffice, and whether any implementation experience exists.

- The strongest point is the observation that introducing a `system_context_replaceability` name could be confusing while `system_context` itself is absent from the working draft.
- The paper gestures toward prior discussion in P3804R1, but does not establish that the proposed direction improves on those alternatives.
- The paper never identifies an affected audience or explains why the problem cannot be handled outside the standard.
- Most glaringly, it offers no implementation experience, no interoperability analysis, and no argument that standardization is the right remedy.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Adding `system_context_replaceability` namespace name to C++26 will cause a lot of confusion because `system_context` does not even exist in the current working draft.
