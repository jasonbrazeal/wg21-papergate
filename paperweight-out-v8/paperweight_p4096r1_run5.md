Verdict: Adequate (7/14)

The paper offers real grounding in implementation experience and a clear statement of the performance and structural problem it wants to solve, but much of the broader case for standardization rests on assertions that are not yet backed by evidence in the document. The thinnest support is around who is affected, what alternatives were seriously considered, and why the necessary properties cannot be achieved outside the standard.

- The strongest support is the concrete, credited experience with Boost.Beast’s layered asynchronous operations and the author’s maintenance of Capy and Corosio.
- The paper clearly establishes why the problem matters by connecting completion-token generality to foreclosed optimizations and by noting that no replacement has shipped as of 2026.
- The claims about affected deployments and prior committee action are asserted but not substantiated within the paper itself.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of established evidence for why a library solution cannot provide the required properties, since the same sentence is offered without supporting argument or demonstration.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): The generality that the completion token provides is genuine, but the cost is that it forecloses the optimizations that networking in C++ has needed for twenty years.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Boost.Beast (Boost 1.66, 2017) deployed three layers of composed asynchronous operations - socket reads into HTTP parsing into WebSocket framing - and every layer required its own state machine, its own intermediate completion handler, and its own lifetime management.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): In 2026, no replacement has shipped.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 33 passes): The work framing imposes requirements on the executor that the continuation framing does not.
