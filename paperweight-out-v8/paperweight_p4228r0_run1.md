Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow foundation for its standardization case: it can point to existing `inplace_vector` precedent, but it leaves most of the burden—motivation, affected users, need for a standard facility, and implementation experience—largely unargued. The thinnest areas are the absence of any demonstration that a standard wording change is necessary and the lack of evidence that the proposed additions have been tried in practice.

- The strongest support is the established prior art in `inplace_vector`’s `try_push_back` and `try_emplace_back`, which gives the proposal a concrete existing model.
- The paper claims the feature matters for low-latency pre-allocation, but it does not establish why that need is significant or widespread enough to justify standardization.
- The paper does not establish why this belongs in the standard rather than in a library, leaving the central standardization question unanswered.
- The most glaring omission is the complete absence of implementation experience, so there is no evidence the proposed API works well in real code.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Now that we have `try_*_back` in `inplace_vector`, we should add it to `vector` and explore adding it to other sequence containers that provide `push_back` and `emplace_back`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): However, there is currently no method to set the capacity, so it is not quite as useful here.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): They are just as useful in `vector`.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 27 passes): when working on a low latency system, it is common to pre-allocate the maximum capacity needed in a vector

candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): In P0843R7, `try_push_back` and `try_emplace_back` were added to `inplace_vector`.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): One could generalize this even more to `deque` so that it returns an `optional<T&>` that is engaged if and only if the `deque` did not perform an internal allocation
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): One could generalize this even more to `deque` so that it returns an `optional&lt;T&>` that is engaged if and only if the `deque` did not perform an internal allocation

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The salient difference between `inplace_vector` and `vector` in this case is whether or not the capacity is known at compile time or only at run time.
