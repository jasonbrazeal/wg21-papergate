Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers solid support in the areas of motivation, prior art, and implementation experience, but it leaves the core question of why standardization is necessary largely unaddressed. The thinnest parts concern the need for a standard change and why a library solution cannot suffice, which weakens the overall case.

- The strongest support comes from implementation experience, where GCC 15 already matches the proposed behavior and the paper documents concrete divergence among major compilers.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives by tying the approach to existing mathematical function behavior and prior committee guidance.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established argument for why the standard itself must change rather than relying on existing or library-level mechanisms.

candidate 1 (found by 6 of 27 passes): The current specification of floating-point overflow is unclear.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Existing code that relied on `max() * 2` being a constant expression will fail to compile.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): There is little motivation to have the core language and the library diverge in this area. At best, a user's compile-time floating-point computations would overflow and turn into infinity, but is that a useful outcome for constant evaluation? Likely not.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): There is little motivation to have the core language and the library diverge in this area.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): This approach is consistent with the design of mathematical functions; for example, `exp(1'000'000)` results in a range error, meaning that infinity is returned and the expression is not constant.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): GCC 15 implements the proposed behavior exactly. Clang and MSVC compilers deviate only slightly.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): It is also worth noting that on [[CWG2168]](https://cplusplus%2egithub%2eio/CWG/issues/2168%2ehtml), SG6 gave some guidance:
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): It also seemingly contradicts the design rationale in the note attached to [[expr.pre] paragraph 4](https://eel.is/c++draft/expr.pre#4).
