Verdict: Weak to Adequate (3/14)

The paper leans heavily on the committee’s general enthusiasm for sender/receiver as a direction, but it does not convert that into a specific case for standardizing the proposed error-handling facility. The support is thinnest where the proposal needs to show why standardization is necessary at all, how it would interoperate with existing practice, and what implementation experience actually demonstrates.

- The strongest support is the repeated committee consensus that sender/receiver is a good basis for asynchronous use cases, which gives the surrounding design context some credibility.
- The paper offers only a claimed basis in the author’s own projects, without showing that those projects validate the specific facility being proposed.
- The discussion of prior art acknowledges that P2300R2 lacks the long deployment history of Asio, but does not turn that admission into a reason for standardizing this particular change.
- The paper is silent on why a library solution would not suffice, on coordination with other proposals, and on what standardization would add beyond what implementers can already do.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 30 passes): "some of the error cases may have been partial successes. In that case, using the set_error channel taking just one argument is somewhat limiting."
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 30 passes): The committee expressed consensus that sender/receiver is a good basis for networking.
