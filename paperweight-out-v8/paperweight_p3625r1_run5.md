Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers only a thin foundation for its own standardization, with the strongest material going to prior art and naming alternatives while the core justifications remain asserted rather than demonstrated. The case is thinnest where it matters most: explaining why this belongs in the standard rather than in a library, and showing that the feature has been implemented and used in practice.

- The paper does establish that the requested semantics have prior art in public documentation and community discussion, and that alternative names were considered.
- The paper claims relevance by saying the authors encountered the need across several projects, but it does not show who else is affected or how widespread the need is.
- The paper offers no argument for why the standard should contain this facility rather than leaving it to ordinary library code.
- The paper provides no implementation experience, leaving the practical viability and design stability of the proposed facility unsupported.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): This paper proposes adding two usability concepts to more concisely express (not) matching a list of types.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): We’ve encountered the need to express a template type parameter matching one of multiple types across several projects.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): We want to point to both the documentation for `same_as` [on cppreference as](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concepts/same_as) [as well as stackoverflow for prior usage/requests to express this semantics.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73377786/c-concept-that-a-type-is-same-as-any-one-of-several-types)
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): We’ve considered the following alternative names and discarded them for the given reasons.
