Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers some useful groundwork, particularly in demonstrating that the proposed query can be implemented with existing reflection facilities, but it leaves several core justifications for standardization largely unargued. The thinnest areas are the absence of any identified user population, any explanation of why a library solution would be insufficient, and any case for why this belongs in the standard rather than remaining an implementation detail or third-party utility.

- The strongest support comes from the concrete implementation experience, including a working sample using Bloomberg’s Clang fork and a Godbolt link.
- The paper also does a reasonable job situating itself against prior art, citing P2996 and showing how far existing reflection metafunctions can go.
- The claim that library implementers already need this functionality is asserted but not connected to any actual users or use cases.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any argument for why a standard facility is needed at all, since the paper does not establish that a library cannot provide the same capability.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): yet there is no way to query whether a type is structural.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The *is_structural_type check* is valuable wherever values (including small user-defined structs) have to be treated as compile‑time constants, since NTTPs must be structural types.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): We provide a sample implementation using other reflection metafunctions from P2996 to demonstrate how far we can go with the existing batch of reflection type queries included in C++26.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996, such as *is_constexpr(info),* *is_literal_type(info)* and *is_lambda_closure_type(info).*
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): [P2996](http://wg21.link/P2996) introduced several metafunctions *(consteval* functions that operate on *meta::info)* in *<meta>* that mirror existing type traits, such as *is_const_type(info), is_volatile_type(info),* and *is_trivially_copyable_type(info).*
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): Given that we now have two similar facilities in the standard library for inspecting type attributes, how should programmers approach them? Should type traits and reflection metafunctions evolve independently?
