Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers some useful groundwork, particularly in its prior-art discussion and the availability of a reference implementation, but it does not sufficiently establish the need for standardization. The central claims about user impact, error-proneness, and the inadequacy of a library solution are asserted rather than demonstrated, leaving the motivation largely unsupported. The thinnest areas are the absence of any coordination or interoperability discussion and the repeated reliance on a single unsubstantiated sentence to carry several distinct burdens.

- The strongest support comes from the established prior art and alternatives section, which correctly situates the proposal against existing `std::lock` and `std::try_lock` facilities.
- The reference implementation is credited as established, giving the paper at least a concrete artifact to point to.
- The most glaring omission is the complete lack of any coordination or interoperability discussion, which leaves the standardization case without a key component.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Users who require timeout-based locking of multiple mutexes must implement their own deadlock-avoidance algorithm, typically via `try_lock()`, `unlock()`, and retry. This is error-prone, verbose, and inconsistent with the existing standard library facilities.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Contrary to `std::lock` / `std::try_lock`, the proposed algorithms accept zero or more lockables.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Existing implementations of `std::lock` already use a deadlock-avoidance algorithm.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 30 passes): C++11 introduced `std::lock` and `std::try_lock` (and C++17 introduced `std::scoped_lock`) to simplify deadlock-free acquisition of multiple lockables.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 30 passes): These algorithms support *BasicLockable* and *Lockable* objects, but there is currently no facility for timed acquisition of multiple *TimedLockable* objects.
