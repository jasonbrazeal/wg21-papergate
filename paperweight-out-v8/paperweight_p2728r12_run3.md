Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper offers solid grounding in implementation experience and a clear account of the problem it addresses, but its case for standardization is uneven: the arguments about who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, and why a library would not suffice are asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest area is coordination and interoperability, where the paper offers no support at all.

- The strongest support comes from the reference implementation and its lineage from an existing libstdc++ implementation detail, which shows the design has been worked through in practice.
- The paper clearly establishes why the problem matters, particularly the mismatch between how UTF text is stored in C++ and the safety concerns around transcoding and invalid input.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is credible, including the relationship to the removed `codecvt` facets and the cited Unicode substitution methodology.
- The most glaring omission is any treatment of coordination and interoperability with other standard components or proposals, leaving a central standardization question unaddressed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 45 passes): Because virtually all UTF-8 text processed by C++ is stored in `char` (and similarly for UTF-16 and `wchar_t`), this means that we need a terse way to smooth over the transition for users.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 45 passes): There are many concerns about these interfaces, particularly with respect to safety.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 45 passes): When a transcoder encounters an invalid subsequence, the modern best practice is to replace it in the output with one or more � characters (`U+FFFD`, `REPLACEMENT CHARACTER`).
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 45 passes): To avoid this situation, the `to_utfN` CPOs reject all inputs that are arrays of `char`, as do the `as_charN_t` casting CPOs.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 45 passes): Because it doesn’t use exceptions, the functionality proposed by this paper can serve as a safe, modern replacement for the deprecated and removed `codecvt` facets.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 45 passes): The methodology for doing so is described in §3.9.6 of the Unicode Standard v17.0, Substitution of Maximal Subparts [[Substitution]](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode17.0.0/core-spec/chapter-3/#G66453).
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 45 passes): An alternative approach to minimize the number of enumerators could merge `truncated_utf8_sequence` with `unpaired_high_surrogate` and merge `unexpected_utf8_continuation_byte` with `unpaired_low_surrogate`, but based on feedback, splitting these up seems to be preferred.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 45 passes): Note that this depends on P4030R0 “Endian Views” for `std::views::from_big_endian`.
