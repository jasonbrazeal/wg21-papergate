Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper offers a solid foundation for its core motivation and design rationale, but it leaves several parts of the standardization case underdeveloped, particularly around who would use the facility and how it fits with existing practice. The strongest material concerns what the proposal would add and why existing tools fall short, while the thinnest concerns the absence of evidence about affected users and interoperability.

- The paper clearly establishes why the proposed `std::multi_lock` matters by contrasting it with `std::scoped_lock` and `std::unique_lock` and by identifying missing multi-mutex timed-lock functions.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is well supported, including the reference to P3832 and the explanation of why a variadic template is preferable to a runtime container.
- The paper provides implementation experience through a complete available implementation, which lends some practical weight to the proposal.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any established account of who is affected by the absence of this facility or how it would coordinate with existing locking conventions and libraries.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Unlike `std::scoped_lock`, which provides only basic RAII semantics, `std::multi_lock` offers the full flexibility of `std::unique_lock` (deferred locking, try-lock operations, timed locking, and ownership transfer) while supporting multiple mutexes simultaneously.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Without `std::multi_lock`, the equivalent code requires either manually managing lock state on every path, or combining `std::try_lock_until` from P3832 with `std::scoped_lock(std::adopt_lock, ...)` — both more verbose and error-prone than the single-line RAII construction above.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The standard library currently lacks `std::try_lock_for` and `std::try_lock_until` functions for multiple mutexes.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Both approaches require all mutexes to be of the same type.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): However, there is no facility that combines the flexibility of `std::unique_lock` with the multi-mutex capabilities of `std::scoped_lock`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Without `std::multi_lock`, the equivalent code requires either manually managing lock state on every path, or combining `std::try_lock_until` from P3832 with `std::scoped_lock(std::adopt_lock, ...)` — both more verbose and error-prone than the single-line RAII construction above.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): [P3832](http://wg21.link/p3832) proposes to add these free functions. This proposal includes corresponding `std::multi_lock` member functions that provide this functionality, possibly by using the two proposed free functions.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The variadic template approach maintains type safety, allows heterogeneous mutex types, and enables compile-time optimizations that would not be possible with a runtime container.

candidate 2 (found by 1 of 36 passes): Additionally, it is probably preferable to keep the interface similar to that of `unique_lock` and `scoped_lock` to complete the family of mutex wrapper classes with a consistent design.
