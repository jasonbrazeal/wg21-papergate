Verdict: Weak to Adequate (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow slice of the case for standardization: it explains why a chunked invocation facility would be useful for mixing `std::simd` with target-specific intrinsics, but it leaves most of the surrounding justification unstated. The thinnest areas are the absence of any demonstrated need for standardization itself, any evidence that a library solution would be insufficient, and any implementation experience.

- The strongest support is the motivation section, which credibly establishes that interacting with intrinsics through smaller pieces of a SIMD value becomes verbose and that a configurable chunk size would help.
- The paper claims some alignment with existing `std::simd` functions and prior naming discussions, but it does not establish that these amount to meaningful prior art or alternatives.
- The paper does not establish who is affected by the problem, leaving the intended audience and the scope of the need unclear.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any case for why this belongs in the standard rather than in a library, alongside the absence of implementation experience or interoperability considerations.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Proposal to extend `std::simd` with a method of allowing a lambda to be invoked on smaller pieces of a SIMD value in order to make interaction with intrinsics easier.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): However, it is inevitable that the programmer will want to make some use of target-specific intrinsics in order to unlock some of the more unusual features of those specific platforms.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): This is now getting verbose, and it only handles `basic_vec` value inputs which are twice the size of a register value.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 21 passes): Being able to define a different size is useful for two reasons:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The function is named `chunked_invoke` and placed in `std::simd` to directly align with related established functions such as `chunk` and `cat`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The draft standard of `std::simd` recommends that provision is made for conversions to and from implementation defined types.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): In the first revision of this paper we proposed that the function which invokes a Callable with an explicit offset should be called with a `_indexed` suffix (e.g., `simd::chunked_invoke_indexed`).
