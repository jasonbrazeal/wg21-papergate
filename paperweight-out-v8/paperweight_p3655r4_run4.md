Verdict: Strong (10/14)

The paper offers substantial evidence that the proposed type addresses a widely felt need and has meaningful implementation experience behind it, but it does not close the loop on why a standard library addition is necessary rather than a shared third-party library. The strongest material concerns existing usage and prior art, while the thinnest concerns the argument for standardization itself and the absence of a case against a library-only solution.

- The paper establishes clear motivation and affected users through widespread existing implementations and active use on GitHub.
- It documents relevant prior art, including an earlier standardization attempt and the relationship to existing string types.
- It shows real implementation experience, including independent implementations with nearly identical features.
- It fails to establish why a library would not suffice, leaving the central standardization rationale incomplete.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): We propose a standard string view type that guarantees null-termination.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): As such, we do believe that there is both space for such a type, and a desire from multiple angles to have it defined in the standard library.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Many functions right now whether C++ standard library calls, operating system calls, or third-party library calls require null-terminated C-style strings.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The use case of having a null-terminated string is much more common, in particular in interaction with C APIs (such as OS APIs, things like the Yubico libfido2 library, libsqlite and others).

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Its wide presence on Github with implementations from among others Microsoft, Google, and many smaller projects, indicates a wide support for the type.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Since the first draft of this paper the use of cstring_view and cstring_view on Github has grown from 1.9k to 2.1k, indicating active use, and in many cases people adding new implementations of the type.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Github code search shows similar popularity between https://github.com/search?q=%2F%5Cbcstring_view%5Cb%2F%20language%3Ac%2B%2B%20-is%3Afork&type=code (1.2k results as of the time of writing) and https://github.com/search?q=%2F%5Cbzstring_view%5Cb%2F+language%3Ac%2B%2B+-is%3Afork&type=code (680 results as of the time of writing).

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Its wide presence on Github with implementations from among others Microsoft, Google, and many smaller projects, indicates a wide support for the type.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): An attempt was made in Feb 2019 to concretely propose the type (renamed to cstring_view) with http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1402r0.pdf, but it failed to gain consensus in LEWGI at https://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21kona2019/P1402.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): There is an adjoint paper (P3862) that proposes to fix this in the existing-but-unpublished C++26 standard to avoid future deviation in having std::string::subview return string_view for subview(n).
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 27 passes): C++14 added std::string_view to that set, offering a non-null-terminated non-owning string type. The type itself raises the question, should we add a non-null-terminated owning string type, and/or a null-terminated non-owning string type?

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): As it's a lingua franca type, it should be part of the standard C++ library.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): As such, we do believe that there is both space for such a type, and a desire from multiple angles to have it defined in the standard library.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): Without them we retain the question we had before - const char*, const std::string& or string_view?
