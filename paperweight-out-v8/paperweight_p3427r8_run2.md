Verdict: Adequate (7/14)

The paper offers real but uneven support for its own standardization, strongest where it can point to production use and a concrete gap in the C++26 hazard pointer interface, and thinnest when it comes to explaining why that gap cannot be filled by a library or how the proposal would fit with existing standardization efforts.

- The paper establishes implementation experience and prior art through the long production history of Folly’s `hazptr_obj_cohort`.
- It establishes why the feature matters by identifying a specific limitation of asynchronous reclamation in the current standard interface.
- It only claims, rather than demonstrates, who is affected, resting on general statements about usability without showing the breadth or nature of the user base.
- It does not establish coordination and interoperability with related standardization work, nor does it make a case for why a library solution would be insufficient.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This paper proposes supporting object cohorts due to the importance of synchronous reclamation for general purpose usability.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Object cohorts have been part of the Folly open-source library (under the name `hazptr_obj_cohort`) and in heavy use in production since 2018.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): The P2530R3 C++26 hazard pointer interface supports only asynchronous reclamation which does not guarantee the timing of the reclamation of protectable objects that are no longer protected.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 33 passes): Doing so avoids burdening the current thread with potentially performing amortized reclamation of tens of thousands of possibly unrelated retired objects, because calling `retire` may trigger amortized asynchronous reclamation.

candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): The main drawback of the global cleanup approach is its high overhead that makes it impractical to use.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): The following table shows two code snippets one using the C++26 hazard pointer interface and one using object cohorts, respectively.
