Verdict: Strong (10/14)

The paper offers solid grounding for its core motivation and for the existence of working implementations, but much of the case for why this belongs in the standard rather than in a library remains asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest support is around the affected audience, interoperability, and the specific standardization need, where the paper gestures at consequences without supplying the evidence or detail that would make them persuasive.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, with complete implementations on three platforms and concrete protocol requirements drawn from that work.
- The motivation is also well established, particularly the explanation of why coroutine resumption and frame allocation require a deliberate protocol.
- The most glaring omission is the affected audience, where a single performance table is offered without enough context to establish who benefits and how broadly.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): For this to work, something must decide where the coroutine resumes, whether it should stop, and where its frame is allocated.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): This is the question that drives the entire protocol. The awaitable cannot just call `h.resume()` - that resumes on the current thread, possibly while holding a lock, possibly re-entering code that is not re-entrant.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Under type erasure, `connect(sndr, rcvr)` produces a type-dependent `op_state` that must be heap-allocated when either side is erased.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 39 passes): Small protocol, big rewards. It earns its keep.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): A companion paper, [P4172R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p4172r0.pdf) [1], provides the design rationale, evidence framework, preemptive objections, and analysis of alternative approaches.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary. Each serves the domain where its design choices pay off.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): See [P4172R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p4172r0.pdf) [1] for design rationale and analysis of alternative approaches.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 39 passes): Interoperable tasks, awaitables
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 39 passes): In a world with multiple coexisting async models, a coroutine that accidentally `co_await`s across model boundaries should fail at compile time, not silently misbehave at runtime.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 39 passes): A TAPS implementation needs coroutines that suspend, resume correctly, cancel, and allocate frames - exactly what this protocol provides.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 39 passes): The left column is small. The right column is not. Small protocol, big rewards. It earns its keep.
