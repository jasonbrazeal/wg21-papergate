Verdict: Weak to Adequate (3/14)

The paper offers a plausible motivation for standard endianness views, but most of its case rests on assertions rather than demonstrated need, leaving the standardization argument thin in several important places. The strongest support is the connection to the existing UTF transcoding adaptor work, while the most serious gaps are the absence of any implementation experience and the failure to explain why a library solution would not suffice.

- The paper’s clearest support comes from its stated relationship to P2728R7, where endianness views would avoid duplicating UTF adaptors for every byte order.
- The claimed relevance to network protocols and file formats suggests broader applicability, but no concrete examples or user evidence are provided to establish who is actually affected.
- The paper does not establish why this facility belongs in the standard rather than in a library, which is a central part of the standardization case.
- The absence of implementation experience leaves the proposal without any demonstration that the design is workable or has been validated in practice.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 21 passes): Rather than introduce a combinatorial explosion of UTF adaptors with various endianness of input and output, we should follow the single responsibility principle and add standard endianness views so users can handle endianness separately.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 21 passes): That paper introduces the adaptors `to_utf8`, `to_utf16`, and `to_utf32`, which take as input ranges of `char8_t`, `char16_t`, and `char32_t`.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): The main reason for adding these views is to assist users of the UTF transcoding range adaptors (see [[P2728R7]](https://wg21.link/p2728r7)).
