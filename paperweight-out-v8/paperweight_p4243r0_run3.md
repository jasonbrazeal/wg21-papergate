Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow justification for its proposed change: it asserts that the current behavior is mathematically incorrect, but it does not build a broader case for why that defect rises to the level of a standardization fix. The thinnest areas are the absence of any discussion of affected users, the need for action in the standard rather than in a library, or evidence that the change has been implemented or coordinated with existing practice.

- The strongest support is the paper’s claim that the current `views::zip()` result is mathematically incorrect, which at least identifies a motivating defect.
- The paper gestures at prior art by citing P2321R2 and range-v3, but it does not establish how those sources support the proposed change rather than the status quo.
- The paper never identifies who is affected by the current behavior or what practical problem it causes for real code.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any argument for why this must be fixed in the standard itself, as opposed to being addressed through a library or left as a known quirk.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): This paper proposes a fix that makes the `views::zip()` ill-formed instead of the current `views::empty<tuple<>>`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 18 passes): The current `views::empty<tuple<>>` is mathematically incorrect.
