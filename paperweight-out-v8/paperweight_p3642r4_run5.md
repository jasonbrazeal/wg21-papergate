Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers meaningful support in a few areas, particularly by grounding the operation in known use cases, citing prior art, and providing a benchmark against an established library implementation. However, the case for standardization is thin where it matters most: the paper does not convincingly show why a library solution is insufficient, why the standard is the right venue, or how the proposal would coordinate with existing practice.

- The strongest support comes from the benchmark comparison with NTL, which gives concrete implementation experience and a measurable performance difference.
- The paper also establishes prior art by explicitly modeling the proposed widening operation on P3161R4.
- The thinnest support is the absence of any coordination or interoperability discussion, leaving the relationship to existing practice unaddressed.
- The claim that library implementations are inadequate because optimal behavior is architecture-dependent is asserted but not demonstrated, so the central argument for standardization remains unproven.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Carry-less multiplication is an important operation in a number of use cases:
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The issue with library implementations is that the optimal implementation for `std::clmul` highly depends on the architecture and has interesting mathematical properties that become opaque in the library.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Such a widening function is important in a various cryptographic use cases.
