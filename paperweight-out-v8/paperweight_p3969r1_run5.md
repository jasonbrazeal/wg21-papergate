Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers a solid rationale for addressing the degenerate `std::bit_cast` case and shows that a library-only solution is not viable, but it leaves several essential parts of the standardization case unstated, particularly around affected users, the need for a standard rather than an implementation-specific fix, and evidence from real implementations.

- The strongest support is the clear explanation of why the current behavior is a dangerous footgun and how the proposed change only rejects code that already contains unconditional undefined behavior.
- The paper also convincingly establishes that a library-based `clear_padding` approach is not a practical alternative, especially in constant evaluation.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is adequate, including the rejected padding-clearing idiom and the connection to `_BitInt` types.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any account of who is affected or how widespread the problem is in real code.
- The paper also does not establish why this requires a standard change rather than a compiler diagnostic or vendor extension, nor does it provide implementation experience to show feasibility.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): This behavior is a footgun, and is not very useful.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): The proposed change only makes the degenerate form of `std::bit_cast` ill-formed, i.e. it raises an error in code that contained unconditional UB.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 30 passes): The single-function solution is problematic because `std::bit_cast` can be used to convert padded types to a byte array without undefined behavior and with zero overhead.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 30 passes): When bit-casting a type containing padding bits to a type with no padding bits, `std::bit_cast` degenerates into an alternative spelling for `std::unreachable` (some exceptions apply).

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): In the discussion of this proposal prior to publication, it was suggested to clear the padding *before* bit-casting. That is, standardizing [`__builtin_clear_padding`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html#index-_005f_005fbuiltin_005fclear_005fpadding) and using an idiom such as:
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 30 passes): Another case where the degenerate form may arise frequently is bit-casting `_BitInt` (supported by Clang as an extension and proposed in [[P3666R3]](https://wg21%2elink/p3666r3))
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 30 passes): R0 of this paper was more ambitious and presented two approaches:
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 30 passes): Another case where the degenerate form may arise frequently is bit-casting `_BitInt` (supported by Clang as an extension and proposed in [[P3666R3]](https://wg21%2elink/p3666r3)), considering that most `_BitInt` types (at least 7/8) have padding bits.
