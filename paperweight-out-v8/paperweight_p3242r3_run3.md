Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers a clear motivation for why efficient copying between `mdspan`s with complex layouts is a real problem worth solving, but it does not build much of a case beyond that initial need. Most of the supporting argument is asserted rather than demonstrated, and the absence of implementation experience or a defined affected audience leaves the standardization rationale thin.

- The strongest support is the concrete statement that copying between contiguous `mdspan`s with the same layout and accessor should be implementable as a single `memcpy`, which grounds the motivation in a recognizable performance goal.
- The paper gestures at prior art by mentioning `std::linalg::copy`, but it does not explain how that facility falls short or what the proposed version would do differently in enough detail to establish the gap.
- The claim that existing standard library facilities are insufficient is repeated without elaboration, so the argument for why a library cannot solve this remains unsubstantiated.
- The most glaring omission is the complete lack of implementation experience, which leaves no evidence that the proposed design is workable or has been validated in practice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): However, without standard library support, copying efficiently between `mdspan`s with mixes of complex layouts is challenging for users.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): For example, if a copy occurs between two `mdspan`s with the same layout mapping type that is contiguous and both use `default_accessor`, the intention is that this could be implemented by a single `memcpy`.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): This paper is proposing a version of `copy` that is not constrained by the number of ranks and differs from `std::linalg::copy` in some important ways outline below.
