Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers a solid conceptual foundation for why a read-only, padding-independent atomic comparison would be useful, but it leaves several practical and procedural questions unanswered. The strongest support concerns the problem statement and the contrast with existing alternatives, while the thinnest areas are the absence of evidence about affected users, implementation experience, and coordination with the broader ecosystem.

- The paper clearly establishes that no existing standard facility provides a consistent, read-only value representation comparison for atomics without either semantic assumptions, padding hazards, or a mutating write.
- It credibly identifies `compare_exchange` as the closest existing mechanism and explains why its coupling to a write makes it an inadequate substitute.
- The paper does not establish who is affected by the absence of `compare_load` or what real-world code would benefit from its standardization.
- It offers no implementation experience or evidence of coordination with implementers, leaving the practical viability of the proposed facility unsubstantiated.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Standard C++ currently lacks a mechanism to perform a consistent, read-only, padding-independent value representation equality check on an atomic object.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): The introduction of `compare_load` provides fundamental concurrency capabilities that cannot be achieved by combining existing standard library facilities
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): These distinct definitions result in behavioral differences when writing concurrent code:
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 33 passes): Currently, `compare_exchange` is the only mechanism in the standard library capable of consistently evaluating value representation equality in the presence of padding, but it couples this evaluation to a mutating memory write.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): `memcmp` is functionally identical to a value representation comparison only for types *without* padding. For types *with* padding, `memcmp` diverges and becomes an unsafe proxy for value equality due to the potential for indeterminate padding bits.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Unlike `operator==` (which relies on semantic logic), `memcmp` (which unsafely evaluates indeterminate padding bits), and `compare_exchange` (which incurs a hardware write), `compare_load` provides a consistent, read-only mechanism to evaluate value representation equality.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): The existing `compare_exchange` operations, `compare_exchange_weak` and `compare_exchange_strong`, defined in **[[atomics.types.operations]](https://eel.is/c++draft/atomics#types.operations)** p21–28, provide the semantic basis for the proposed `compare_load` function.
