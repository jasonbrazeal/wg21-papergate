Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers only a narrow basis for its own standardization: the existence of an implementation is the one point that is actually established, while the surrounding case rests largely on assertions rather than demonstrated need. The thinnest areas are the absence of any account of who is affected and the lack of coordination or interoperability analysis, which leaves the proposal’s relevance to the broader ecosystem unexamined.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, since the proposed design has been put into practice at the linked repository.
- The paper asserts that a dedicated `node-handle` is necessary for portable code, but it does not establish that claim with evidence or analysis.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is asserted rather than established, leaving the comparison to existing node-based containers underdeveloped.
- The most glaring omission is the complete lack of any discussion of who is affected, making it impossible to judge the proposal’s practical reach or urgency.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): As we can’t come up with a convincing use-case for such a facility, we don’t propose them and suggest future proposals on this topic to introduce a dedicated `multi-node-handle` instead of changing the conceptual design of `node-handle`.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 30 passes): Transfer of expensive-to-move or outright immovable objects.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 30 passes): Separation of extraction and insertion (compared to the traditional splice-API), thereby enabling: Modifications of the otherwise immutable key.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): We agree with the criticism that there is a lack of consistency with other node-based sequences, but think the advantages of this new API are very clear:
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 30 passes): As `forward_list` is singly-linked it cannot efficiently support the same API as other sequence containers. Therefore its API has been adapted in name and semantics, resulting in member functions like `erase_after` instead of `erase`.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 30 passes): The proposed design has been implemented at https://github.com/MFHava/STL/tree/P3049.
