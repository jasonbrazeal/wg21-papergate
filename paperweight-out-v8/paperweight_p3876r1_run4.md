Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers a mixed case for its own standardization, with the strongest support coming from its explanation of the problem and its demonstration that existing implementations already do the underlying work. The thinnest parts are the arguments that this belongs in the standard rather than in a library, and that it coordinates cleanly with the broader ecosystem.

- The paper clearly establishes why `char8_t` support matters for real-world use cases like JSON and UTF-8 text handling.
- The paper credibly shows prior art and implementation experience, since existing `to_chars`/`from_chars` implementations are already numerically doing what is proposed.
- The paper does not establish why this must be standardized rather than provided by a library, especially since the workaround exists but is merely inconvenient.
- The paper does not establish coordination and interoperability beyond a single passing reference to JSON, leaving the ecosystem impact largely unexamined.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): `std::to_chars` and `std::from_chars` currently only provide support for `char`, which causes several usability problems.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Due to how common UTF-8 is and due to `char8_t` now regularly being used to represent UTF-8 text in C++ software, the motivation in §2. Introduction mostly refers to `char8_t`.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): File formats such as JSON require the use of Unicode character encodings, so an application that deals with JSON may want to use `char8_t` in its APIs and internally.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The lack of support for `char8_t` (and other character types) severely limits what can be done elsewhere:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The user could use the `std::to_chars(char*, char*, int, int)` overload and then transcode to UTF-8 as `char8_t`, but the standard library provides no transcoding facilities yet.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): It is worth noting that there is a stale proposal [[P2584R0]](https://wg21%2elink/p2584r0) "A More Composable `from_chars`" which proposes additional overloads taking `std::span`, superseding the even more stale [[P2007R0]](https://wg21%2elink/p2007r0) "`std::from_chars` should work with `std::string_view`".
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): All implementations are quite similar: the underlying function performing the conversion is a function template with type parameter `T`, to handle integer types or floating-point types in bulk.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The proposal is a pure extension of the `std::to_chars` and `std::from_chars` overload sets.
