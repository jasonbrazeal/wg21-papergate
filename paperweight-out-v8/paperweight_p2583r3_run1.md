Verdict: Strong (9/14)

The paper offers solid grounding for the problem it identifies and for the existence of a protocol-level remedy, but its case for standardization rests heavily on assertions about library convergence and the necessity of changing the standard rather than working within existing libraries. The thinnest support appears where the paper claims broad ecosystem impact and where it argues that a library-level solution cannot suffice.

- The strongest support is the concrete demonstration of the stack-growth problem and the documented protocol-level alternative with draft wording.
- The paper also credibly establishes that the author has practical implementation experience with the proposed direction.
- The claim that five of six major coroutine libraries already converge on symmetric transfer is asserted rather than shown with evidence.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of established evidence that the required sweeping changes to sender algorithms and completion signatures cannot be achieved outside the standard.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): When a coroutine co_awaits a sender that completes synchronously, the stack grows by one frame per completion.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Under the current protocol, the sender model's architectural choice - composing operations through non-coroutine sender algorithms with void-returning completions - prevents this mechanism from operating.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 24 passes): Five of six libraries converge on the same mechanism: `await_suspend` returns a `coroutine_handle<>`.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 24 passes): Every major C++ coroutine library the authors surveyed uses symmetric transfer in its task type.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): A protocol-level fix exists: completion functions and `start()` return `coroutine_handle<>` instead of `void`, enabling struct receivers to propagate handles from downstream without becoming coroutines.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): An alternative approach is possible: make the return type a compile-time property of the receiver.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 24 passes): This paper documents a cost inside the composition mechanism. Sender algorithms are structs. The completion protocol is void-returning. These are not boundary properties.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 24 passes): This section provides draft wording for the broad fix described in Section 11 - the protocol-level change where completion functions and start() return coroutine_handle<> instead of void.

candidate 3 (found by 1 of 24 passes): A trampoline scheduler is a runtime mitigation. It detects excessive stack depth and reschedules. This is the runtime overhead in the completion path that [P0913R1] was specifically adopted to eliminate.
