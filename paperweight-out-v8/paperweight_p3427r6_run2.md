Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper’s strongest case rests on the demonstrated production use of object cohorts in Folly since 2018, which gives real weight to its claims of practical viability and performance. Beyond that, however, the argument for standardization is largely asserted rather than shown: the affected audience, the need for a standard facility rather than a library, and the interoperability story are all thin, with little evidence connecting the proposal to a broader C++ ecosystem need.

- The paper establishes meaningful implementation experience through years of heavy production use in Folly, which is the most concrete support it offers.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is grounded in a concrete comparison with the existing hazard pointer interface and a clear rationale for preferring object cohorts over global cleanup.
- The case for why this belongs in the standard, rather than remaining a library facility, is asserted without substantiation.
- The paper does not establish who is affected beyond a general appeal to performance-sensitive users, leaving the breadth and urgency of the need unclear.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This paper proposes supporting object cohorts due to the importance of synchronous reclamation for general purpose usability.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): While its guarantees are weaker and less flexible than global cleanup, its efficiency enables users to use it in performance sensitive cases where the cost of global cleanup may be impractical.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Doing so avoids burdening the current thread with potentially performing amortized reclamation of tens of thousands of possibly unrelated retired objects, because calling `retire` may trigger amortized asynchronous reclamation.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): Object cohorts have been part of the Folly open-source library (under the name `hazptr_obj_cohort`) and in heavy use in production since 2018.

candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The following table shows two code snippets one using the P2530R3 C++26 hazard pointer interface and one using object cohorts, respectively.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Therefore a free function hazard_pointer_try_reclamation() is added, so that users can write the cohort equivalent to the above non-cohort code snippet as follows:
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): We do not recommend the standardization of the global cleanup approach due to these drawbacks and the lack of production experience of the necessity of such approach in contrast to the more efficient approach discussed in the following section.
