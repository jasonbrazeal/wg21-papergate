Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers meaningful support in a few areas, particularly the conceptual gap it identifies and the implementation experience from Boost.URL, but it leaves the central case for standardization largely unargued. The thinnest parts are the absence of a rationale for why this belongs in the standard rather than a library, and the lack of any established interoperability or standardization need.

- The strongest support is the documented implementation experience, with Boost.URL’s validating default and explicit unsafe escape hatch showing the design has been exercised in practice.
- The paper clearly establishes why the type matters by distinguishing it from `std::string` and `std::string_view` and framing it around safe-by-default composition.
- The evidence for who is affected and for prior art is only asserted through GitHub counts and named libraries, without enough detail to establish the claimed breadth of demand.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any argument for why the standard is the right venue, or why a library solution would not suffice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): C++ should make the safe thing easy, and the unsafe thing possible.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 18 passes): The type fills a real gap: `std::string` owns and null-terminates, `std::string_view` does not own and does not null-terminate, and `cstring_view` does not own but does null-terminate.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 18 passes): The evidence documents a recurring design value: safe by default, with explicit escape hatches where zero-cost composition requires them.
