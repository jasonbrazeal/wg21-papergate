Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers a narrow but real justification for its naming choice, grounded in prior discussion and a reconsideration of earlier proposals, but it leaves most of the case for standardization unaddressed. The support is thinnest around the basic questions of who needs this facility, why it belongs in the standard rather than a library, and whether anyone has tried building it.

- The strongest support is the established account of prior art, showing how the proposed name emerged from P3091’s alternatives and subsequent reflection on `get`.
- The paper also establishes why the name matters, arguing that an unbounded `get` returning `optional` would be inconsistent with existing library conventions.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established need from users or affected parties, leaving the motivating audience unspecified.
- Equally unestablished are the arguments for standardization itself, including why a library solution would not suffice and what implementation experience exists.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Since that time, even the author of P3091 has reconsidered the implications of the name `get`.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 24 passes): We conclude that a `get` function returning `optional` after an unbounded search would make it unique among uses of `get` in the library, and so would be inconsistent and confusing.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 24 passes): The name of the desired operation should reflect that the lookup may take variable time and could return without finding the value being sought; existing instances of `get` in the Library forbid both.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): P3091 offered names `get_optional` and `lookup_optional`, which failed to evoke enthusiasm in Sofia; and `lookup`, which had supporters, but failed to reach consensus.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): The name `get_optional` mentioned in P3091 is not proposed, for reasons that should be clear.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 24 passes): Since that time, even the author of P3091 has reconsidered the implications of the name `get`.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 24 passes): [[P3091R5]](https://wg21.link/p3091r5), forwarded to LWG for C++29, adds member functions `get` to associative containers in the Standard Library.
