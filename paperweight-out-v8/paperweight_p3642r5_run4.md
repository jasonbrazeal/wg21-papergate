Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers a mixed case for its own standardization, with its strongest support resting on recognized use cases, relevant prior art, and a concrete implementation signal from LLVM. The thinnest parts concern the actual population of affected users, the necessity of standardization over a library, and any coordination or interoperability story.

- The paper clearly establishes that carry-less multiplication matters for cryptographic and other use cases and that existing proposals and LLVM already provide related or portable functionality.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is substantive, connecting the proposal to P3104R3, P3161R4, and P4052R0 rather than treating the design space as empty.
- The claims about why a library will not do and why the standard should act are asserted mainly through a single architectural-dependence argument, without enough supporting evidence to move beyond a claim.
- The paper offers no coordination or interoperability discussion, leaving a notable gap in the case for standardization.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Carry-less multiplication is an important operation in a number of use cases:
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The issue with library implementations is that the optimal implementation for `std::clmul` highly depends on the architecture and has interesting mathematical properties that become opaque in the library.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Such a widening function is important in a various cryptographic use cases.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): In the example above, `std::clmul(x, x)` is equivalent to [[P3104R3]](https://wg21%2elink/p3104r3)'s `std::bit_expand(x, 0x55555555u)`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Such a naive implementation is far from optimal though. [[QuickBench]](https://quick-bench%2ecom/q/eG4Q5BR_udnfh4V5f-3d3h3fRHY) shows that a naive `clmul` implementation which computes both the high and the low bits performs 9.2× worse than an efficient implementation taken from [[NTL]](https://github%2ecom/libntl/ntl).
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): I also propose a widening operation in the style of [[P3161R4]](https://wg21%2elink/p3161r4)
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Most of the design choices take the design of [[P3161R4]] and [[P4052R0]] into consideration:
