Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers meaningful support in a few areas, particularly by grounding its rationale in existing implementation behavior and prior committee discussion, but it leaves several essential parts of the standardization case unaddressed. The thinnest support concerns why a standard change is necessary at all and why a library-level solution would be insufficient.

- The strongest support comes from implementation experience, with GCC 15 already matching the proposed behavior and Clang and MSVC differing only slightly.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives by citing the design rationale in [[expr.pre] paragraph 4](https://eel.is/c++draft/expr.pre#4) and the earlier SG6 request in CWG2168.
- The case for who is affected rests mainly on a compiler-behavior table, but the paper does not show that real code or users are impacted in practice.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any argument for why the core language standard, rather than a library specification or implementation guidance, must be changed.

candidate 1 (found by 5 of 27 passes): The current specification of floating-point overflow is unclear.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): There is little motivation to have the core language and the library diverge in this area.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Existing code that relied on `max() * 2` being a constant expression will fail to compile.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The current specification of floating-point overflow is unclear. Floating-point overflow occurs when finite operands are used as operands, and the result cannot be represented as a finite value.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): It also seemingly contradicts the design rationale in the note attached to [[expr.pre] paragraph 4](https://eel.is/c++draft/expr.pre#4).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): GCC 15 implements the proposed behavior exactly. Clang and MSVC compilers deviate only slightly.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): As requested by SG6 in [[CWG2168]](https://cplusplus%2egithub%2eio/CWG/issues/2168%2ehtml) in 2016, it should not be a constant expression.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): This approach is consistent with the design of mathematical functions; for example, `exp(1'000'000)` results in a range error, meaning that infinity is returned and the expression is not constant.
