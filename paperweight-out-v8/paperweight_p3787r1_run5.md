Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a thin, mostly asserted case for its own standardization, leaning on the precedent of P2248R8 and a similar hotfix rather than demonstrating the need, affected users, or standardization rationale directly. The support is thinnest around the basic questions of who is affected and why a library-level solution or no standard change would be insufficient.

- The strongest support is the claimed continuity with P2248R8, which the paper presents as an adopted change that this proposal would extend to a missed algorithm.
- The paper also gestures at implementation experience by noting that implementations already shipping P2248R8 make a macro bump safer, though this is only asserted.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established discussion of who is affected by the current state of the API or what practical problem it causes.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Due to an oversight, the `std::uninitialized_fill` family of algorithms was excluded from the ones where a defaulted template parameter was added.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): We extend the same changes that [P2248R8] applied to the rest of the find algorithms to `std(::ranges)::uninitialized_fill`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): In the Tokyo 2024 meeting [P2248R8] (Enabling list-initialization for algorithms) was adopted.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): [P3217R0] was also submitted as a similar fix for `find_last`. That proposal did **not** bump the feature-test macro, as it was considered a "hotfix".
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): [P3217R0] was also submitted as a similar fix for `find_last`.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 21 passes): there are already implementations shipping with [P2248R8], and therefore we consider it safer to bump the value again.
