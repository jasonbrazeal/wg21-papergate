Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers only partial support for its own standardization, with its strongest material concerning prior art and alternatives, while several essential parts of the case—especially who is affected, coordination and interoperability, and implementation experience—are left entirely unaddressed. The remaining points about motivation, the need for standard wording, and the inadequacy of a library solution are asserted rather than demonstrated, leaving the overall argument thin where it most needs to be concrete.

- The paper does establish that its approach is distinct from `std::start_lifetime_as` and that a related prior proposal took a different route, which grounds the discussion in existing work.
- The paper claims, but does not establish, why the problem matters, tying it to a goal for `std::inplace_vector` without showing the broader stakes.
- The paper claims, but does not establish, that a library-only solution is inadequate, resting the argument on a single syntactic example rather than a general limitation.
- The paper offers no evidence at all about who is affected, how the change would interact with other features or implementations, or whether anyone has tried the approach in practice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): This is also a problem because the original goal of the paper was to make types like `std::inplace_vector` completely usable at compile-time, and this rule (even separate from [[P3074R7]](https://wg21.link/p3074r7)) makes that impossible:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): This is notably distinct from `std::start_lifetime_as<T>` since that function also recursively begins the lifetime of all implicit-lifetime subobjects, and in this context we need that to not happen.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): That paper solved this problem by: 1. Making `union`s have trivial default constructors and trivial destructors, by default, and 2. Implicitly starting the lifetime of the first `union` member, if that member has implicit-lifetime type.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): [[P3074R7] (trivial `union`s (was `std::uninitialized<T>`))](https://wg21.link/p3074r7) was adopted in Hagenberg.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): As a production implementation wouldn’t write `new (&storage[n]) T`, it’d write `::new ((void*)std::addressof(storage[n]) T`. Having to pattern match on syntax makes this wording approach increasingly complicated, if not outright weird given the call to a standard library function in there.
