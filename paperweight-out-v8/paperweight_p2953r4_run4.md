Verdict: Adequate (7/14)

The paper offers a narrow but concrete case for its own standardization, grounded in implementation experience and a clear articulation of the language-design concern. The support is thinnest where it matters most for a standards change: showing why the standard itself must change, how the change coordinates with existing practice, and why a library-level remedy is impossible.

- The strongest support comes from the implemented wording in Clang forks and successful compilation of large codebases, which demonstrates that the proposed restriction is technically feasible.
- The paper clearly establishes why the current permission matters, by identifying the implausible declarations and explaining how they make C++ harder to understand.
- The claim that real users are affected rests on a GitHub search and an expectation about template programming, but the paper does not establish actual user impact.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any argument for why the standard is the right place to address this, or why a library solution cannot suffice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): This permits implausible declarations like `A& operator=(const A&) && = default`, where the left-hand operand is rvalue-ref-qualified.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): We have also searched for any real-world use of these operator overloads to assess deployment.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Our concern is that the *unrealistic* declaration `A& operator=(const A&) && = default` is *permitted!* This has several minor drawbacks:
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The possibility of these unrealistic declarations makes C++ harder to understand.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Searching GitHub for [rvalue-ref-qualified defaulted assignment](https://github.com/search?q=lang%3Acpp+%2Foperator%3D%5C%28%5B%5E%29%5D%2B%5C%29+%26%26+%3D+default%2F+&type=code) currently yields around 1.5k results.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 27 passes): These signatures are similarly arcane, we expect that no users make use of them, and these signatures don’t help with template programming either
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): we expect that no users make use of them, and these signatures don’t help with template programming either
