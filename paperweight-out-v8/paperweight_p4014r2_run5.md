Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper gives a mixed account of its own readiness, with the strongest material concentrated in conceptual background and implementation experience, while the case for why this belongs in the standard rather than a library is largely asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest areas are the absence of any discussion of who is affected and the lack of a substantive argument that a library solution would be insufficient.

- The paper clearly grounds its design in established prior art, including Moggi’s functorial action, Kleisli arrows, and existing scheduler affinity and effect-masking work.
- It offers credible implementation experience through references to stdexec, sender-examples, Capy, and Corosio.
- Its claims about the standard being the right home for these abstractions rest on repeated assertions about shared vocabulary and structured concurrency, without showing why standardization is necessary.
- The paper never identifies who would be affected by the proposal or why a library implementation would not suffice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 60 passes): Regular C++ has no dedicated cancellation channel; the three-channel model is one of the properties the Sub-Language adds.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 60 passes): Sometimes the next step in a computation is itself a whole new computation.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 60 passes): A pipeline sometimes needs to ask its surroundings a question - what scheduler am I running on, what allocator should I use, has anyone asked me to stop?
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 60 passes): Sometimes the shape of a completion does not quite fit what the next stage expects.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 60 passes): These are the functorial action on morphisms [6] - Moggi's `fmap`, the lifting T(f) : T(A) -> T(B) for a function f : A -> B.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 60 passes): A Kleisli arrow [6] [15] is a morphism A -> T(B) - a function from a plain value to a computation.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 60 passes): affine is the scheduler affinity primitive, redesigned by P3941R4 [16] and renamed from affine_on by P4151R1 [17].
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 60 passes): Theory: This is effect masking in the algebraic-effects framework [12].

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 60 passes): The following examples are drawn from the [stdexec](https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec) [25] reference implementation (whose algorithm customization model is addressed by [P3826R5](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p3826r5.html) ("Fix Sender Algorithm Customization") [26]) and the [sender-examples](https://github.com/steve-downey/sender-examples) [27] repository.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 60 passes): Falco developed and maintains [Capy](https://github.com/cppalliance/capy) [3] and [Corosio](https://github.com/cppalliance/corosio) [4] and believes coroutine-native I/O is a practical foundation for networking in C++.
