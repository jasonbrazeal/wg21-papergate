Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers a narrow but real evidentiary base: it shows a working bridge implementation and situates that bridge against existing sender/awaitable work, but it leaves the central case for standardization largely asserted rather than argued. The thinnest support concerns who is affected, why a library would not suffice, and what specifically requires action by the standard.

- The strongest support is implementation experience, with compiled output and use of community implementations of `std::execution` demonstrating that the bridge works in practice.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives by connecting its `await_sender` design to `IoAwaitable` from P4003R3 and to sender/receiver concepts from P2300R10.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established reason a library cannot provide the same capability, leaving the need for standardization itself unsupported.

  [13] Appendix A. Bridge Implementation            0/0/0  -> 0.00
candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): An `IoAwaitable` bridge ([P4003R3](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P4003R3.pdf) [1]) consumes `std::execution` ([P2300R10](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p2300r10.html) [2]) senders with inline operation state, correct stop token propagation, and automatic executor dispatch-back.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary. Each serves the domain where its design choices pay off.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): `await_sender` returns a `sender_awaitable` satisfying `IoAwaitable` ([P4003R3](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P4003R3.pdf) [1]).
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 39 passes): compiled with MSVC 19.43 against [Capy](https://github.com/cppalliance/capy) [3] and `beman::execution` [5] (a community implementation of `std::execution`)
