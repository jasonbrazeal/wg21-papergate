Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper gives a solid account of why the core-language problem matters and what the viable design alternatives are, but it leaves several practical justifications asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest support concerns who is actually affected and whether the proposed direction is coordinated with existing practice and library constraints.

- The strongest support is the paper’s explanation that this addresses open core and library issues, with no known library-only fix.
- It also credibly establishes prior art and alternatives by tracing the design intent and current implementation behavior.
- The paper claims but does not establish implementation experience, since it offers only brief assertions that implementations accept the feature.
- The most glaring omission is any discussion of who is affected, leaving the user-facing impact of the problem unstated.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): addressing both CWG 3003 and LWG 4381.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): There is no known fix for the library wording without changes to the core language, see LWG 4381.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This means that default template arguments specified on the template template parameters are ignored during deduction and that types can be deduced that can’t otherwise be written using the name of the template template parameter.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 33 passes): This currently crashes most implementations, but as the *defining-type-id* of Alias doesn’t denote a deducible template, it should just be ill-formed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): it was pointed out that it was not the design intent of P0091R3 "Template argument deduction for class templates (Rev. 6)" to disallow CTAD for template template parameters.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Current implementations accept the above examples (except for the last one) with the "simple substitution" semantics.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): But since [P0552R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0522r0.html) "DR: Matching of template template-arguments excludes compatible templates", a template template argument doesn’t have to match a template template parameter exactly; the template template parameter just needs to be more specialized than the template template argument.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 33 passes): But this looks like something that should be addressed by a future revision of P3579R0 "Fix matching of non-type template parameters when matching template template parameters"
