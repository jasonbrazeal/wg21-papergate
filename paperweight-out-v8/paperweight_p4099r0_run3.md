Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper does establish why the problem matters and shows meaningful engagement with prior art and alternatives, but it leaves several essential parts of the standardization case asserted rather than demonstrated. The support is thinnest around who is affected, implementation experience, and the reasons the work belongs in the standard rather than in a library.

- The strongest support is the paper’s account of how a series of design decisions produced a long gap in standardized networking and why the proposed model addresses properties that have resisted prior attempts.
- The paper also credibly situates its approach against existing work, including the complementary relationship between coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution`.
- The case weakens where the same passage is asked to carry the burden for standardization, coordination, and the insufficiency of a library solution without separate supporting argument.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established affected audience or implementation experience, leaving the practical demand and feasibility of the proposal largely unshown.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Four decisions, each locally reasonable, each under-evidenced, produced a decade without networking in the C++ standard.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): The first choice produces type-erased streams, separate compilation, and ABI stability - properties that have been difficult to achieve in twenty years of networking attempts.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): The coroutine executor concept constrains the handle type to `coroutine_handle<>`, restoring the type constraint that the rename from `dispatch`/`post`/`defer` to `execute(F&&)` removed.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 33 passes): The sender/receiver model provides structured concurrency, sender composition, completion signatures as type-level contracts, and a customization point model that enables heterogeneous dispatch.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This paper assembles the findings of five companion papers into a single causal chain
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary. Each serves the domain where its design choices pay off.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): The coroutine executor concept constrains the handle type to `coroutine_handle<>`, restoring the type constraint that the rename from `dispatch`/`post`/`defer` to `execute(F&&)` removed.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 33 passes): The technical analysis is in `std::execution::task` ([P3552R3](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3552r3.html)[16]) already fuses both models.
