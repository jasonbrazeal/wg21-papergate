Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers some grounding for its motivation and design lineage, but it leaves the standardization case largely unbuilt: the affected audience, the need for a standard facility rather than a library solution, interoperability concerns, and implementation experience are all absent from the argument. The strongest material concerns the prior discussion of `affine_on` and the alternatives considered, while the thinnest areas leave the proposal without a clear constituency or evidence of viability.

- The paper establishes that prior discussion of `affine_on` raised concerns and pointed toward a revised design, and it situates that design against earlier proposals such as P3718R0 and the original `task`/`continues_on` approach.
- The paper does not establish who is affected by the proposed change or why their needs require standardization.
- The paper does not establish why the standard, rather than a library facility, is the right vehicle for the proposed behavior.
- The paper offers no implementation experience, coordination analysis, or interoperability evidence to support moving the design into the standard.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): There were multiple concerns raised against the specification of `affine_on` and discussed as part of [P3796R1](https://wg21.link/P3796R1).
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 15 passes): The discussion on `affine_on` revealed some aspects which were not quite clear previously and taking these into account points towards a better design than was previously specified:

candidate 4 (found by 1 of 15 passes): Changing the scheduler affects the coroutine until the end of the coroutine or until `change_coroutine_scheduler` is `co_await`ed again.

candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): [P3718R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3718r0.html) is, however, discontinued (for unrelated reasons) and adding the guarantee to get the current scheduler from a receiver query is proposed here.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The original proposal for `task` used `continues_on` to schedule the work back on the original scheduler.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 15 passes): [ Editor's note: This wording is relative to [N5032](https://wg21.link/N5032) with the changes from [P3826r3](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p3826r3.html) applied. ]
