Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers solid evidence of implementation experience and some useful grounding in prior art, but it leaves several central questions about the need for standardization largely unargued. The thinnest support concerns who would be affected by the proposal and why an ordinary library would be insufficient, which are essential for justifying committee action.

- The strongest support is the demonstrated implementation experience, with compiled output and use of community implementations of `std::execution`.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives by situating the bridge between coroutine-native I/O and sender/receiver models.
- The case for why the standard itself is needed rests almost entirely on the assertion that the bridge proves coexistence, without explaining what standardization would add.
- Most glaringly, the paper never establishes who is affected or why a library cannot deliver the same result.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): A single class template bridges sender-based code into coroutine-native I/O with inline operation state, correct stop propagation, and automatic dispatch-back.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): The bridge is the proof that coexistence works.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 39 passes): The bridge avoids both mechanisms:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary. Each serves the domain where its design choices pay off.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): `await_sender` returns a `sender_awaitable` satisfying `IoAwaitable` ([P4003R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p4003r0.pdf)[1]).
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): compiled with MSVC 19.43 against [Capy](https://github.com/cppalliance/capy)[3] and `beman::execution`[5] (a community implementation of `std::execution`)
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 39 passes): The error-code dispatch is the consuming side of the **abstraction floor** ([P4093R0](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P4093R0.pdf)[6] Section 4):
