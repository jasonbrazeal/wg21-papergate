Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers a reasonably grounded motivation for returning `optional<T&>` from certain standard library algorithms, and it gestures toward relevant prior art, but it does not build a complete case for standardization. The support is thinnest around who is actually affected, why a library solution is insufficient, and whether the proposed change has meaningful implementation experience.

- The strongest support is the concrete enumeration of benefits for `optional<T&>` as a return type, which anchors the paper’s motivation in a real API design question.
- The paper also credibly cites prior art from Rust and earlier C++ discussions, showing that optional references are a known and practiced idea outside this specific proposal.
- The case for why this belongs in the standard, rather than in a library or as a narrower API change, is asserted but not demonstrated.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any discussion of who is affected by the change, leaving the audience and impact of the proposal unclear.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): There are several significant benefits to `optional<T&>` when it comes to the return type here, which we will enumerate.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): But the notion of an optional reference in general is not new, and we have a lot of experience with it outside of the standard library — and even outside of C++.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 24 passes): We argue in this paper that there is a better choice for the return type for each of these algorithms
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 24 passes): We argue in this paper that there is a better choice for the return type for each of these algorithms: `optional<reference>` for the first three

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): The Rust standard library returns optional references from many APIs quite liberally.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 24 passes): We are aware that [[P3739R4] (Standard Library Hardening - using std::optional)](https://wg21.link/p3739r4) exists, but we feel that this is an important change to make, and that paper’s motivation is weak
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 24 passes): When [[P0843R14] (inplace_vector)](https://wg21.link/p0843r14) was adopted, the only sensible choice for the return type was `T*`: either a pointer that points to the new element or a null pointer.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 24 passes): Barry wrote a whole blog post several years about about how [`T*` makes for a poor `optional<T&>`](https://brevzin.github.io/c++/2021/12/13/optional-ref-ptr/) responding to this claim.
