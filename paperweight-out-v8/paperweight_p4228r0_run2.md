Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow basis for its own standardization: it can point to existing prior art in `inplace_vector`, but it does not establish who is affected, why a library solution is insufficient, or that there is implementation experience. The thinnest support concerns the actual need for a standard change, since the motivation and the argument for standardization are asserted rather than demonstrated.

- The strongest support is the established prior art, showing that `try_push_back` and `try_emplace_back` already exist in `inplace_vector` and could plausibly be extended to `vector`.
- The paper claims the feature matters because it would be useful in `vector`, but it does not establish the practical significance or the affected user base.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any implementation experience, leaving the proposal without evidence that the design is workable or beneficial in practice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Now that we have `try_*_back` in `inplace_vector`, we should add it to `vector` and explore adding it to other sequence containers that provide `push_back` and `emplace_back`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): However, there is currently no method to set the capacity, so it is not quite as useful here.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Now that we have `try_*_back` in `inplace_vector`, we should add it to `vector` and explore adding it to other sequence containers that provide `push_back` and `emplace_back`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): One could generalize this even more to `deque` so that it returns an `optional<T&>` that is engaged if and only if the `deque` did not perform an internal allocation
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): In P0843R7, `try_push_back` and `try_emplace_back` were added to `inplace_vector`.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): In P0843R7, `try_push_back` and `try_emplace_back` were added to `inplace_vector`. They are just as useful in `vector`.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The salient difference between `inplace_vector` and `vector` in this case is whether or not the capacity is known at compile time or only at run time.
