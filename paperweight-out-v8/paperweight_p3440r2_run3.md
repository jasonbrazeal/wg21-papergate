Verdict: Adequate to Strong (8/14)

The paper offers solid support for the usefulness of the proposed function and for the existence of viable alternatives, but its case for standardization rests heavily on assertions about implementation experience and target-specific efficiency that are not backed up with evidence. The thinnest parts concern why this cannot remain a library facility and what coordination or interoperability benefits the standard would actually provide.

- The strongest support is the clear motivation around loop remainders and the correctness pitfalls of manual mask generation.
- The paper also credibly establishes that alternatives exist and that a free function fits the existing `std::simd` design.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of substantiated implementation experience beyond a single vendor’s internal use.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Such a function is notably useful for handling loop remainders.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Manual mask generation introduces subtle correctness issues for corner cases.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The avoidance of unnecessary preconditions maintains semantic consistency with `partial_load` and `partial_store` which similarly accept empty ranges, partial ranges, and oversized ranges without precondition violations.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 21 passes): It makes generating efficient mask remainders across all Intel targets efficient and easy, and it makes the code’s intent very obvious.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Without `mask_from_count`, there are several ways to create that mask, three variants of which are illustrated here:
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Following `std::simd`’s design principle, all operations that can be free functions are free functions.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Intel’s implementation of `std::simd` has had this function (albeit as a named constructor) since very early on, and it is used throughout our example code base.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): By making this function part of `std::simd` itself, the implementation can choose the most efficient implementation for the target and correctly handle all possible corner cases

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The integer bit-manipulation approach only works if the integer type is large enough - using a `uint16_t` value to generate a 64-bit mask will silently fail on some targets.
