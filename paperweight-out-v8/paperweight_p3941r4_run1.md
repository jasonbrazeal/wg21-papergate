Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers only a narrow foundation for its own standardization, centered on the problems identified with `affine_on` and the existence of a prior scheduling approach. That support is thinnest around the practical and institutional questions: who is affected, why this belongs in the standard rather than a library, how it interoperates with existing facilities, and whether anyone has implemented it.

- The paper establishes that the change matters by connecting it to concrete concerns raised against `affine_on` in prior discussion.
- It also establishes awareness of prior art and alternatives, including the earlier `continues_on` approach.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established implementation experience, leaving the proposal without evidence that the design has been tried in practice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): There were multiple concerns raised against the specification of `affine_on` and discussed as part of [P3796R1](https://wg21.link/P3796R1).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The discussion on `affine_on` revealed some aspects which were not quite clear previously and taking these into account points towards a better design than was previously specified:
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 15 passes): It isn’t adding any new functionality but removes a problematic way to achieve something which can be better achieved differently.
