Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper gives a clear and credible account of why the change matters, but much of the supporting evidence for adoption rests on assertions about implementation experience and compiler behavior rather than independently verifiable detail. The thinnest parts concern coordination with other proposals and a demonstration that the same goals could not be met outside the standard.

- The strongest support is the concrete motivation: replacing a closed element-type list with trait-based constraints would extend `std::simd` to enumerations, `std::byte`, and user-defined types while preserving existing behavior.
- The paper repeatedly cites implementation experience in Intel’s `std::simd` and with Clang and Intel oneAPI, but it does not establish that experience with enough specificity to count as demonstrated evidence.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives gestures at consistency with scalar operations and related proposals, but does not establish that those alternatives were adequately explored.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established case for coordination and interoperability with other standardization efforts or for why a library-only solution would be insufficient.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 48 passes): This minimal change enables type safety, strong typedefs, enumerations, and `std::byte` while maintaining full backward compatibility.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 48 passes): The C++ standard library includes data-parallel types in the `<simd>` header, currently restricting element types to a closed list: arithmetic types and `std::complex` specializations.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 48 passes): To ensure user-defined types work correctly with `std::simd`, we impose constraints that match hardware capabilities and prevent subtle bugs.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 48 passes): This prevents subtle bugs where user-defined operators return incorrect types.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 48 passes): Implementation experience (§ 6 Implementation Experience) demonstrates that with current leading compilers (Clang and Intel oneAPI), these types can generate assembly identical to built-in arithmetic types for standard operations.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 48 passes): We implemented this approach in Intel’s `std::simd` implementation and tested across multiple Intel architectures.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 48 passes): By relying on compiler optimization, we can open `simd` to user-defined types without requiring customization points for basic operations.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 48 passes): This paper proposes a minimal change to the specification in which the closed list is replaced with trait-based constraints that handle all existing types while naturally extend support to enumerations, `std::byte` and user-defined types.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 48 passes): Implementation experience with leading compilers (Clang 20, Intel oneAPI 2025.0) has shown that they can.
