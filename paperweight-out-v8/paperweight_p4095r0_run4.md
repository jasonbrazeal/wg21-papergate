Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers a narrow but real foundation for its case: it explains why the error-propagation problem matters under one framing and situates its diagnosis in prior work, but it leaves most of the standardization burden unaddressed. The support is thinnest where a proposal most needs to be concrete—who is affected, why a standard is required, how the feature would coordinate with existing specifications, and what implementation experience actually demonstrates.

- The paper establishes that implementation-defined error handling leaves callers without a channel back to learn what happened, and that this matters under the work framing.
- It credibly grounds its analysis in prior papers and distinguishes its framing from earlier critiques, including the observation that the Networking TS loses something when the continuation property is removed.
- The paper does not establish who is affected by the problem or why the standard, rather than a library, is the right place to address it.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established case for coordination and interoperability with the existing standard or with adjacent proposals.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): "Any errors that happen, whether during task submission, after submission and prior to execution, or during task execution, are handled in an implementation-defined manner, which can vary from executor to executor."
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Error propagation | No channel. Implementation-defined.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): Under the work framing, this is true. The caller submitted work and continued. The caller is alive, running, and expects to learn what happened. The error has no channel back to the caller.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 36 passes): No paper evaluates what the Networking TS loses when the continuation property is removed from the executor concept.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This paper documents what [P1525R0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1525r0.pdf)[1], "One-Way execute is a Poor Basis Operation," analyzed, what it did not analyze, and applies the two-framing distinction from [P4094R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p4094r0.pdf)[2] to its diagnosis.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This section applies both framings to each of [P1525R0]'s four deficiencies.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The three papers that drove the pivot - [P1525R0], [P1658R0], [P1660R0] - do not mention `async_result`, [N3747], or the continuation framing.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary. Each serves the domain where its design choices pay off.
