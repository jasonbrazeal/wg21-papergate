Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow slice of the case for standardization: it explains why the wording problem matters and gestures toward a possible wording strategy, but it leaves nearly every other necessary justification unaddressed. The support is thinnest around the basic questions of who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, and whether the approach has been implemented or coordinated with the broader ecosystem.

- The strongest support is the explanation of why the receiver must know the operation state location and why implementers currently lack a computable formulation of completion functions.
- The paper’s treatment of prior art and alternatives is only claimed, since it mostly references P3425 and repeats its findings rather than establishing an independent comparison.
- The paper does not establish who is affected by the problem or why the standard should address it.
- The most glaring omission is the complete absence of implementation experience, coordination, and any argument that a library solution would be insufficient.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 18 passes): The receiver needs to know the location of the operation state to which asynchronous control flows upon completion of a child operation.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 18 passes): The above has the effect that implementers of `std::execution` must write code which computes the completion functions potentially-evaluated by the algorithms they are implementing, but does not provide code which performs that computation.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 18 passes): The receiver is a C++ object and must be passed as an argument to `std::execution::set_value` (§33.7.2 [exec.set.value]), `::set_error` (§33.7.3 [exec.set.error]), or `::set_done` (§33.7.4 [exec.set.stopped]) to complete the asynchronous operation.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 18 passes): The situation is not quite as dire as is presented in the preceding section.

candidate 2 (found by 3 of 18 passes): The above is the primary finding of P3425.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 18 passes): A similar strategy can be used to word P3425:
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 18 passes): The above change is taken from P3425 verbatim.
