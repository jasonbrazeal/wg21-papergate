Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers a narrow but genuine rationale for exposing a structural-type query, grounded in the needs of non-type template parameters and library mandates, but it leaves most of the standardization case undeveloped. The strongest material concerns why such a query would be useful, while the argument for putting it in the standard—rather than in a library or a future reflection facility—is largely absent.

- The paper clearly establishes that users and library implementers need a way to ask whether a type is structural, and that no exposed query currently exists.
- The discussion of prior art gestures toward P2996 and a sample implementation, but it does not demonstrate that the proposed facility is the right standardization vehicle.
- The paper does not establish who is affected, why the standard is necessary, or how the feature would coordinate with existing and upcoming reflection work.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any case for why a library solution would not suffice, which leaves the central standardization question unanswered.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The *is_structural_type check* is valuable wherever values (including small user-defined structs) have to be treated as compile‑time constants, since NTTPs must be structural types.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): yet there is no way to query whether a type is structural.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): Library mandates clauses mean that library implementers must somehow have this functionality, but it is simply not exposed to users.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): We provide a sample implementation using other reflection metafunctions from P2996 to demonstrate how far we can go with the existing batch of reflection type queries included in C++26.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996, such as *is_constexpr(info),* *is_literal_type(info)* and *is_lambda_closure_type(info).*
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): [P2996](http://wg21.link/P2996) introduced several metafunctions *(consteval* functions that operate on *meta::info)* in *<meta>* that mirror existing type traits, such as *is_const_type(info), is_volatile_type(info),* and *is_trivially_copyable_type(info).*
