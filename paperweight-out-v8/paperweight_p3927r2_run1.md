Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers a narrow but real basis for its standardization case: it clearly motivates the problem and shows an implementation, but it leaves most of the surrounding argument unstated. The thinnest areas are the absence of any identified audience, the lack of a case for why this belongs in the standard rather than a library, and the silence on coordination with adjacent facilities.

- The strongest support is the concrete motivation showing that `task_scheduler` fails to preserve parallelization when wrapping a `parallel_scheduler`, which the paper identifies as exactly the behavior it wants to fix.
- The implementation experience is also established, with the solution present in the `stdexec` reference implementation as of early 2026.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is only gestured at through references to P3941R3, without establishing how those alternatives were evaluated or why they are insufficient.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any established case for why the standard is the right venue, why a library solution will not do, or how the proposal coordinates with existing scheduling and execution facilities.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): if a `task_scheduler` wraps a `parallel_scheduler` and is used to launch parallel work with a `bulk` sender, the work is not parallelized as it would be had a `parallel_scheduler` been used directly.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): These are precisely the operations we would like `task_scheduler` to handle.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): Currently, `task_scheduler` is specified to have an exposition-only member *`sch_`* of type `shared_ptr&lt;void>`.
