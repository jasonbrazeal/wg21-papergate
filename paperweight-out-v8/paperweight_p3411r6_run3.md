Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers solid grounding in existing practice and prior art, but its case for standardization is uneven: the motivation and implementation experience are well supported, while the arguments about affected users, ABI coordination, and why a library solution is insufficient remain largely asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest parts are precisely those that would justify taking this work into the standard rather than leaving it as a widely available library component.

- The strongest support comes from implementation experience, with multiple existing implementations, reference code, and constexpr support credited as established.
- The paper also establishes why the problem matters, particularly the compilation-time and dependency costs of un-erased range APIs and the design focus on function parameters at API boundaries.
- Prior art and alternatives are established through connections to `std::span`, range-v3, and a named-arguments design inspiration.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established argument for why a library will not do, leaving the central question of standardization necessity unaddressed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): In large applications, such liberal use of `std::ranges` can lead to increased header dependencies and often a significant compilation time penalty.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Due to the lack of type erasure utilities, typically the API takes a `vector`, even though the implementation only needs to iterate once over the elements.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): The design space of `any_view` is a lot more complex than that:
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 33 passes): In Wrocław meeting, one important point was made: The majority of the use case of `any_view` is to use it as a function parameter in the API boundary.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): `std::span<T>` is another type-erasure utility recently added to the standard; and is closely related to ranges in fact, by allowing type-erased *reference* of any underlying *contiguous* range of objects.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This is inspired by Barry’s [blog post](https://brevzin.github.io/c++/2019/12/02/named-arguments/).
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): `any_view` has been implemented in [[range-v3]](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3), with equivalent semantics as proposed here.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 33 passes): `range-v3` uses the name `category` for the category enumeration type. However, the authors believe that the name `std::ranges::category` is too general and it should be reserved for more general purpose utility in ranges library.
