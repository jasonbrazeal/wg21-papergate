Verdict: Adequate (7/14)

The paper gives a reasonably grounded account of the problem and of existing approaches, but it does not yet make a persuasive case that the proposed facility belongs in the standard rather than in a library. The strongest material concerns prior art and implementation experience, while the thinnest concerns who is concretely affected and why standardization, rather than a library solution, is necessary.

- The paper clearly establishes that type-erased structural interfaces are a recurring need and that existing facilities such as `std::function`, `std::any`, and `proxy` occupy related design space.
- The reference implementation and its use of code generation provide concrete evidence that the idea has been explored in practice.
- The paper claims, but does not demonstrate, that the affected audience extends beyond authors of existing type-erasure utilities or that current ad-hoc solutions impose a standardization-level burden.
- The most glaring omission is a sustained argument for why a library cannot adequately provide the proposed facility, especially given that the paper itself describes a working library-based reference implementation.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Any type that provides member functions with the same names and function signatures as those specified by the interface is considered to be *conforming* to the protocol.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Standard library facilities such as `std::function`, `std::any`, `std::ranges::any_view` and the many other type-erasure based solutions demonstrate that the need for dynamic structural interfaces is both real and recurring.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): There is currently no function-type in the standard library that can represent an overload set.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Ideally both `protocol` and `protocol_view` would be generated by the compiler using static reflection, eliminating hand-written type-erasure boilerplate or custom build steps.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This paper explores a different approach to proxy and relies on reflection rather than templates for a smaller API surface.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Standard library facilities such as `std::function`, `std::any`, `std::ranges::any_view` and the many other type-erasure based solutions demonstrate that the need for dynamic structural interfaces is both real and recurring.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): `proxy` (P3086, implemented in `ngcpp/proxy`) occupies an overlapping region of the design space: both proposals provide type-erased, non-intrusive runtime polymorphism without requiring inheritance.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 36 passes): However, these solutions are implemented in an ad-hoc manner, requiring significant boilerplate and leading to inconsistent semantics across libraries.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 36 passes): `proxy` requires the author to build a *Facade* explicitly using the `pro::facade_builder` template, combining dispatch objects such as `pro::member_dispatch` with `add_convention` calls.
