Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a thin evidentiary basis for its own standardization, with most of the necessary case left unstated rather than argued. The strongest material appears in the discussion of prior art and alternatives, but even there the claims are asserted rather than demonstrated, and the remaining categories are essentially silent.

- The paper at least gestures toward prior work and alternative designs, though it does not establish that those alternatives were adequately explored or found insufficient.
- The claim about foreclosing automatic frame allocator propagation hints at why the design might matter, but it is not developed into a concrete rationale.
- The paper does not identify who would be affected by the proposal or what problem they currently face.
- Most notably, it offers no account of why a library solution would not suffice, why standardization is the right venue, or what implementation experience supports the design.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary. Each serves the domain where its design choices pay off.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Of these, Croydon resolved six: Unusual Allocator Customisation, Flexible Allocator Position, and Shadowing The Environment Allocator were addressed by P3980R1 [6]
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): A design where frame allocation participates in environment-based propagation is foreclosed without a language change to coroutine allocation.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): Croydon resolved several.
