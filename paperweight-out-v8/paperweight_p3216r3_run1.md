Verdict: Adequate (7/14)

The paper gives a partial account of why `views::slice` deserves standardization, with its strongest material concentrated in motivation, prior art, and implementation experience. The case becomes much thinner when it turns to the need for a standard facility rather than a library component, and it is effectively silent on who would be affected and how the feature would coordinate with existing range machinery.

- The paper clearly establishes that slicing is a familiar operation in other languages and that existing C++ compositions are more verbose and less direct.
- It also provides concrete implementation experience, including a libstdc++-based prototype and attention to boundary-checking behavior.
- The argument for why this must be standardized rather than remain a library facility is asserted but not substantiated.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any discussion of affected users or interoperability with existing standard range components.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): This paper proposes the Tier 1 adaptor `views::slice` (as described in [P2760](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2760r1.html)) to enhance the C++29 ranges library.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): While it is possible to achieve slicing today with `views::drop(start) | views::take(end - start)`, this composition, while valid, may obscure the programmer's intent due to its verbosity.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 24 passes): While `views::drop` and `views::take` provide compositional power, a dedicated `slice_view` offers better API consistency, performance, and expressiveness.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Many mainstream languages, such as Python and Rust, offer built-in slice syntax, making it a familiar and expected feature for developers.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): In range-v3, the special variable `*end*` is supported in `views::slice`, allowing users to write expressions like `views::slice(M, *end* - N)` to indicate slicing from index `M` up to `N` elements before the end of the range.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 24 passes): This paper proposes the Tier 1 adaptor `views::slice` (as described in [P2760](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2760r1.html))
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 24 passes): [*Drafting note:* The definition of this sentinel class is exactly the same as that of `take_view::*sentinel*`, and it seems worthwhile to reuse it in some way.]

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 24 passes): In the C++ ecosystem, while the Ranges library has greatly enhanced composability and expressiveness, it currently lacks a direct, ergonomic, and standard way to perform slicing by index.

  [8] References                                   0/0/0  -> 0.00
candidate 1 (found by 2 of 24 passes): In range/v3, `views::slice` is also implemented with a dedicated view class, but it does **not** perform any boundary checking.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 24 passes): Unlike `subrange` and `counted`, which have limitations when working with only-input or non-sized range types, `views::slice` can be designed to work generically with any range, making it broadly applicable.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 24 passes): In range-v3, the special variable `*end*` is supported in `views::slice`, allowing users to write expressions like `views::slice(M, *end* - N)` to indicate slicing from index `M` up to `N` elements before the end of the range.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): The author implemented `views::slice` based on libstdc++, see [here](https://godbolt.org/z/o3aYd7jzT).
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 24 passes): In contrast, the proposed `views::slice` includes comprehensive boundary checking just like `views::take` and `views::drop`; it will safely adjust or clamp the specified indices as appropriate, ensuring well-defined and predictable behavior.
