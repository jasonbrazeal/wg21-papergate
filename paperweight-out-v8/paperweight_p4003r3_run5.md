Verdict: Strong (10/14)

The paper offers solid grounding in implementation experience and a clear articulation of the core problem, but its case for standardization rests heavily on assertions that are not yet backed by evidence in the document itself. The thinnest support appears where the paper claims broad affected audiences, necessity for language-level action, and interoperability benefits without demonstrating them directly.

- The strongest support comes from the complete three-platform implementation and the companion rationale paper, which together establish that the design has been built and tested.
- The paper clearly establishes why the problem matters by explaining the coroutine resumption, allocation, and cross-model failure risks that motivate the protocol.
- The case for why this belongs in the standard rather than a library is claimed but not established, since the cited language-level advantages and type-erasure costs are asserted without supporting demonstration.
- The most glaring omission is the affected-audience evidence, where a single performance table is presented without enough context to establish who is actually impacted or how broadly.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): For this to work, something must decide where the coroutine resumes, whether it should stop, and where its frame is allocated.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): This is the question that drives the entire protocol. The awaitable cannot just call `h.resume()` - that resumes on the current thread, possibly while holding a lock, possibly re-entering code that is not re-entrant.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): In a world with multiple coexisting async models, a coroutine that accidentally `co_await`s across model boundaries should fail at compile time, not silently misbehave at runtime.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Under type erasure, `connect(sndr, rcvr)` produces a type-dependent `op_state` that must be heap-allocated when either side is erased.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): The language provides what a library would reimplement.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 39 passes): The sender composition algebra does not apply to compound results - such as `[ec, n]` - without data loss or shared state; the sender three-channel model is in tension with `error_code` as a value-channel result.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 39 passes): The *IoAwaitable* protocol provides the coroutine execution model beneath it.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 39 passes): Under type erasure, `connect(sndr, rcvr)` produces a type-dependent `op_state` that must be heap-allocated when either side is erased.
