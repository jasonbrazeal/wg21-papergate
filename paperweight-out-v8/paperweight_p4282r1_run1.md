Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow foundation for its standardization case: it establishes that the proposal updates an accepted design and that the prior approach was awkward, but it leaves most of the burden of justification unaddressed. The thinnest areas are the absence of any account of who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, how the change coordinates with related facilities, and whether there is implementation experience.

- The strongest support is the established prior art and alternatives, since the paper correctly ties its change to the now-accepted P3950 and explains the earlier workaround.
- The stated motivation is only claimed, not established, because the paper asserts the lack of a bona fide way to emit stopped but does not substantiate why that matters in practice.
- The most glaring omissions are the complete lack of discussion of affected users, standardization necessity, interoperability, library-only feasibility, and implementation experience.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): While `std::execution::task` supports stopped completion signals the promise type has no bona fide manner in which the coroutine body can emit them.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Previously if the author of a coroutine body which uses `std::execution::task` wished to end the asynchronous operation with stopped they had to write `co_await` `std::execution::just_stopped()`.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): This paper updates the design and wording of `std::execution::task` given the adoption of P3950 [1].
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): P3950 [1] proposed changing the above.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): P3950 has now been accepted into the C++29 working draft and therefore the above can be revisited.
