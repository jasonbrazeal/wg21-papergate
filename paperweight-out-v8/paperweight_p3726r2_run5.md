Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper’s support for its own standardization is uneven: it does a solid job explaining how prior work addressed a related problem and why that approach is not suitable here, but it leaves several essential parts of the case largely unargued. The thinnest areas are the failure to identify who is affected, the absence of any discussion of coordination or interoperability, and the lack of a convincing explanation for why a library solution cannot suffice.

- The strongest part of the paper is its account of prior art, showing clearly how an earlier proposal solved a similar problem and why its mechanism is distinct from `std::start_lifetime_as`.
- The discussion of why the standard is needed gestures at real wording complications, but it is asserted rather than demonstrated as a barrier that standardization must resolve.
- The paper claims implementation experience only by describing what a production implementation would write, without showing that such an implementation exists or has been tried.
- Most glaringly, the paper never establishes who is affected by the problem, nor does it address coordination and interoperability or explain why a library-based approach would be inadequate.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): This is also a problem because the original goal of the paper was to make types like `std::inplace_vector` completely usable at compile-time, and this rule (even separate from [[P3074R7]](https://wg21.link/p3074r7)) makes that impossible:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): That paper solved this problem by: 1. Making `union`s have trivial default constructors and trivial destructors, by default, and 2. Implicitly starting the lifetime of the first `union` member, if that member has implicit-lifetime type.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): This is notably distinct from `std::start_lifetime_as<T>` since that function also recursively begins the lifetime of all implicit-lifetime subobjects, and in this context we need that to not happen.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): As a production implementation wouldn’t write `new (&storage[n]) T`, it’d write `::new ((void*)std::addressof(storage[n]) T`. Having to pattern match on syntax makes this wording approach increasingly complicated, if not outright weird given the call to a standard library function in there.
