Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers a partial but uneven case for standardization, with its strongest material concentrated in the motivating gap it identifies and the implementation experience it can cite. The argument thins considerably when it moves from “this is a useful type” to “this belongs in the standard library,” leaving the interoperability story and the limits of a non-standard library solution essentially unaddressed.

- The paper’s clearest support comes from its framing of the type as filling a genuine gap between owning, null-terminated strings and non-owning, non-terminated views, reinforced by a shipped Boost.URL implementation.
- The demand evidence is suggestive but not persuasive, since the cited GitHub implementations are asserted rather than analyzed for what they show about a common unmet need.
- The prior art and “why the standard” arguments gesture at existing library patterns and zero-cost principles, but they do not yet connect those generalities to this specific proposal.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any discussion of coordination with existing string facilities or why a standalone library cannot serve the need, leaving the standardization rationale incomplete.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): C++ should make the safe thing easy, and the unsafe thing possible.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 18 passes): The type fills a real gap: `std::string` owns and null-terminates, `std::string_view` does not own and does not null-terminate, and `cstring_view` does not own but does null-terminate.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 18 passes): The evidence documents a recurring design value: safe by default, with explicit escape hatches where zero-cost composition requires them.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 18 passes): The standard library already provides constrained defaults with explicit broader counterparts.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 18 passes): C++ earns its reputation as a zero-cost abstraction language by letting programmers pay only for what they use.
