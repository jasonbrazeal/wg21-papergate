Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers a solid demonstration that the proposed mechanism can be implemented and that it addresses a real gap in how coroutine I/O results interact with the sender model, but its case for standardization is uneven: the strongest evidence is practical, while the arguments about affected users, prior art, and interoperability remain more asserted than shown. The thinnest parts are the absence of any argument for why this belongs in the standard rather than a library, and the lack of a clear statement about who is concretely affected.

- The paper’s implementation experience is its strongest support, with a complete implementation and a zero-allocation delay example beyond the coroutine frame.
- The motivation is clearly established: compound I/O results are rejected at compile time, and the coroutine body becomes an unavoidable translation layer that loses either composition or values.
- The discussion of prior art and coordination with the sender model gestures at relevant alternatives and algorithms, but does not establish that the proposed approach is the right or necessary one.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any case for why a library solution cannot suffice, leaving the central standardization question unaddressed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 48 passes): Awaitables returning compound I/O results - any tuple-like whose first element is `error_code` with additional elements - are rejected at compile time.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 48 passes): The coroutine body is the translation layer: inspect the compound result, perform application logic, return the error code.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 48 passes): Neither option preserves both values and retains composition.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 48 passes): The sender model provides three completion channels: `set_value` for success, `set_error` for failure, and `set_stopped` for cancellation.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 48 passes): An `IoAwaitable` ([P4003R1](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p4003r1.pdf)[1]) can be wrapped as a `std::execution` sender.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 48 passes): `as_sender` wraps any `IoAwaitable` as a `std::execution` sender.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 48 passes): Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary. Each serves the domain where its design choices pay off.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 48 passes): [P4090R0](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P4090R0.pdf)[7] documented the trade-off: route the whole pair through `set_value` and the composition algebra is bypassed; decompose it and the byte count is destroyed on error because `set_error` carries only the `error_code`.
