Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper offers solid grounding for the existence of the problem and for its chosen technical direction, but it does not yet make a complete case that this specific facility belongs in the standard. The strongest material concerns prior art, implementation experience, and the recurring need for structural interfaces, while the thinnest support appears around why a library solution would be insufficient and how the proposal would coordinate with existing standard facilities.

- The paper clearly establishes that dynamic structural interfaces are a recurring need and that the proposed reflection-based approach has prior art and a working reference implementation.
- It also establishes that the design assumes static reflection and code injection, and that it occupies an overlapping but distinct space from existing proposals such as `proxy`.
- The paper claims but does not fully establish who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, or how the feature would interoperate with existing type-erasure facilities.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established argument for why a library implementation would not be sufficient.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Any type that provides member functions with the same names and function signatures as those specified by the interface is considered to be *conforming* to the protocol.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Standard library facilities such as `std::function`, `std::any`, `std::ranges::any_view` and the many other typeerasure based solutions demonstrate that the need for dynamic structural interfaces is both real and recurring.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): There is currently no function-type in the standard library that can represent an overload set.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 36 passes): This paper explores a different approach to proxy and relies on reflection rather than templates for a smaller API surface.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This proposal assumes the availability of static reflection and code injection and focuses solely on the design of the class templates `protocol` and `protocol_view`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This paper explores a different approach to proxy and relies on reflection rather than templates for a smaller API surface.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Standard library facilities such as `std::function`, `std::any`, `std::ranges::any_view` and the many other typeerasure based solutions demonstrate that the need for dynamic structural interfaces is both real and recurring.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): `proxy` (P3086, implemented in `ngcpp/proxy`) occupies an overlapping region of the design space: both proposals provide type-erased, non-intrusive runtime polymorphism without requiring inheritance.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This paper proposes protocol types as a first-class library feature that fills this gap.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 36 passes): Ideally both `protocol` and `protocol_view` would be generated by the compiler using static reflection, eliminating hand-written type-erasure boilerplate or custom build steps.
