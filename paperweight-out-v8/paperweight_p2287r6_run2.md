Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers only a narrow slice of the case for standardization: it can point to implementation experience, but most of the surrounding justification rests on assertions rather than demonstrated need, and the standard-specific rationale is absent. The thinnest areas are the failure to show why the standard must change or why a library solution cannot address the problem, leaving the proposal’s motivation largely anecdotal.

- The strongest support is implementation experience, with both a GCC extension and a Clang implementation cited as evidence that the feature is technically feasible.
- The paper claims prior art and alternatives were considered, but it does not establish what was learned from those alternatives or why they are insufficient.
- The affected-user argument is asserted through a single upgrade-breakage anecdote, without showing how widespread or representative that breakage is.
- The most glaring omission is the complete absence of a case for why this belongs in the standard at all, rather than remaining a compiler extension or being handled another way.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 21 passes): While I can initialize an `A` like `A{.a=1}`, I cannot designated-initialize `B`.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 21 passes): However, the two do not mix: a designated initializer can currently only refer to a direct non-static data members.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 21 passes): We actually had some code break while upgrading to C++20 that initialized aggregates in this way.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 21 passes): gcc in `-std=c++17` mode — still to this day on trunk — supports `B{{.a=1}, .b=2}`. We actually had some code break while upgrading to C++20 that initialized aggregates in this way.
