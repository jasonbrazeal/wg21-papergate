Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper gives a clear reason why a rank-agnostic copy for `mdspan` would be useful, but it offers little concrete evidence about the affected audience, existing practice, or implementation experience. The case for standardization rests mostly on assertions that current facilities are insufficient, without demonstrating that a library solution cannot fill the gap or that the proposed design has been tried in practice.

- The strongest support is the established need for efficient copying across `mdspan`s with complex layouts and arbitrary rank, which the paper states directly.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is thin, citing only the existence of C++23 `mdspan` without showing how other approaches were evaluated.
- The paper repeatedly claims that existing standard library facilities are insufficient and that a library will not do, but it does not substantiate those claims with examples or analysis.
- The most glaring omission is the complete absence of implementation experience or evidence about who is affected, leaving the practical demand for this facility unestablished.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): However, without standard library support, copying efficiently between `mdspan`s with mixes of complex layouts is challenging for users.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): This operation only applies to `mdspan`s with \(rank \le 2\). This paper is proposing a version of `copy` that is not constrained by the number of ranks and differs from `std::linalg::copy` in some important ways outline below.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): This operation only applies to `mdspan`s with \(rank \le 2\). This paper is proposing a version of `copy` that is not constrained by the number of ranks

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): However, existing standard library facilities are not sufficient here. Currently, `mdspan` does not have iterators or ranges that represent the span of the `mdspan`.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 21 passes): We settled on `<mdspan>` because as proposed this is a relatively light-weight addition that reflects operations that are commonly desired with `mdspan`s.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 21 passes): Many applications, including high-performance computing (HPC), image processing, computer graphics, etc that benefit from `mdspan` also would benefit from basic memory operations provided in standard algorithms such as copy and fill.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 21 passes): One possibility would be to remove `std::linalg::copy`, as it is a subset of the proposed `std::copy`.
