Verdict: Strong (9/14)

The paper offers solid grounding in prior work and alternatives, and it clearly explains why the pointer-lifetime problem matters for existing concurrent and volatile-based code. Its support is thinnest when it moves from asserting widespread production use and the necessity of a standard solution to demonstrating those claims with concrete evidence, implementation experience, or a clear argument that a library approach cannot suffice.

- The strongest support is the paper’s connection to established prior art, including P2434R4, P1726R4, and the Treiber stack, which situates the proposal within a known design lineage.
- The paper also clearly establishes why the issue matters by tying it to long-standing usage of loads, stores, comparisons, and dereferencing of pointers in concurrent and sequential algorithms.
- The case for coordination and interoperability is reasonably grounded in the need for `volatile` accesses to forgive invalidity when passing virtual addresses between device drivers and firmware.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of concrete implementation experience or production-code evidence beyond repeated assertions, leaving the claimed decades of use and de facto status quo largely unsubstantiated.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): it is not consistent with long-standing usage, especially for a range of concurrent and sequential algorithms that rely on loads, stores, equality comparisons, and even dereferencing of such pointers.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): In order to support a number of critically important algorithms, this paper proposes a convenience mechanism in which `std::atomic<T*>` and `volatile` have special behavior so that the associated pointer values become prospective
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Note that `volatile` accesses must necessarily forgive invalidity in order to support passing of virtual addresses to and from I/O devices.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 39 passes): This code is buggy because it is subject to lifetime-end pointer zap:
