Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper gives a mixed account of its own case, with solid grounding in implementation experience and prior art but much thinner evidence for the importance, affected audience, and necessity of standardization. The weakest areas concern coordination with existing practice and the claim that this cannot be done as an ordinary library.

- The strongest support is the demonstrated implementation experience, including compiler output and a reference implementation compatible with all three major compilers.
- The paper also establishes relevant prior art and alternatives, connecting the proposed operations to existing bit-manipulation facilities and known algorithms.
- The case for why the standard is the right venue is established, particularly through the argument that optimization-time information cannot be used through current ISO C++ mechanisms.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established coordination or interoperability discussion, leaving the relationship to other standards and implementations unaddressed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): However, there are still a few operations which are non-trivial to implement in software and have widely available hardware support.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The utility functions in `<bit>` are not meant to provide a full bitwise manipulation library, but fundamental operations, especially those that can be accelerated in hardware while still having reasonable software fallbacks.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The C++ bit manipulation library in `<bit>` is an invaluable abstraction from hardware operations.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): It is worth noting that clang provides a cross-platform family of intrinsics. [`__builtin_bitreverse`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#builtin-bitreverse) uses byte-swapping or bit-reversal instructions if possible.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): [Warren1] presents algorithms which are the basis for [Schultke1].
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): The use of `compress` and `expand` is consistent with the mask-based permutations for `std::simd` proposed in [P2664R6].
