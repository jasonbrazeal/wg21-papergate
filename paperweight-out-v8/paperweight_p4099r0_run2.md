Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers a clear and well-sourced account of why the design choices it examines matter and how they relate to prior work, but it does not adequately establish who is affected, what implementation experience exists, or why the standard is the necessary home for the work. The strongest material concerns the historical and technical context; the thinnest concerns the practical case for standardization itself.

- The paper convincingly traces a decade of missed networking standardization to a chain of locally reasonable decisions and shows how the sender/receiver model addresses long-standing difficulties.
- It credibly situates the proposal against prior art and alternatives, including the complementary relationship with coroutine-native I/O and the fusion already explored in P3552R3.
- The claim that neither model can acquire the other’s properties without surrendering its own is asserted rather than demonstrated, leaving the “why a library will not do” case under-supported.
- The paper does not identify who is affected or report any implementation experience, which leaves the practical urgency and feasibility of standardization largely unestablished.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Four decisions, each locally reasonable, each under-evidenced, produced a decade without networking in the C++ standard.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): The first choice produces type-erased streams, separate compilation, and ABI stability - properties that have been difficult to achieve in twenty years of networking attempts.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 33 passes): Each decision was locally reasonable, made by experienced practitioners under real constraints.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 33 passes): The sender/receiver model provides structured concurrency, sender composition, completion signatures as type-level contracts, and a customization point model that enables heterogeneous dispatch.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This paper assembles the findings of five companion papers into a single causal chain
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): The coroutine executor concept constrains the handle type to `coroutine_handle<>`, restoring the type constraint that the rename from `dispatch`/`post`/`defer` to `execute(F&&)` removed.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary. Each serves the domain where its design choices pay off.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 33 passes): The technical analysis is in `std::execution::task` ([P3552R3](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3552r3.html)[16]) already fuses both models.
