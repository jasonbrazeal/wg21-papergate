Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper gestures toward a plausible need and a clean design rationale, but it does not actually build the case for standardization. Most of its support rests on repeated assertions that users need endian-specific UTF conversions, without evidence, examples, or discussion of existing practice. The thinnest areas are the complete absence of implementation experience and any argument for why a library solution would be insufficient.

- The strongest support is the design argument that separating endianness handling from UTF transcoding avoids a combinatorial explosion of adaptors.
- The paper claims broader applicability to network protocols and file formats, but this remains an unsupported assertion rather than a demonstrated need.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any implementation experience or library-based alternative analysis, leaving the standardization need essentially unargued.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Rather than introduce a combinatorial explosion of UTF adaptors with various endianness of input and output, we should follow the single responsibility principle and add standard endianness views so users can handle endianness separately.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 21 passes): This paper depends on [[P3117R1]](https://wg21.link/p3117r1) “Extending Conditionally Borrowed”.
