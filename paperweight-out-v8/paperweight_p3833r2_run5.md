Verdict: Adequate (7/14)

The paper offers a solid foundation for its standardization case by clearly motivating the gap in current mutex wrappers, pointing to relevant prior work, and providing an implementation, but it leaves several important parts of the argument largely unaddressed. The thinnest areas concern who specifically needs this facility, how it would coordinate with existing or planned standardization work, and why a library solution would be insufficient.

- The strongest support comes from the clear articulation of the practical gap between `std::scoped_lock` and the need for deferred, timed, and heterogeneous multi-mutex locking.
- The paper also benefits from citing prior art in P3832 and offering a complete implementation, which grounds the proposal in existing work and experience.
- The argument for why this belongs in the standard rather than a library is asserted mainly through the variadic template design, but the paper does not develop that into a convincing case.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any discussion of who is affected by the problem, leaving the audience and impact of the proposal unclear.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Unlike `std::scoped_lock`, which provides only basic RAII semantics, `std::multi_lock` offers the full flexibility of `std::unique_lock` (deferred locking, try-lock operations, timed locking, and ownership transfer) while supporting multiple mutexes simultaneously.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): This gap forces developers to choose between: 1. Using `std::scoped_lock` and restructuring code to avoid deferred/timed locking scenarios 2. Managing multiple `std::unique_lock` objects manually, which is verbose and error-prone
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Both approaches require all mutexes to be of the same type.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 36 passes): Uses deadlock-free acquisition of multiple mutexes

candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): [P3832](http://wg21.link/p3832) proposes to add these free functions. This proposal includes corresponding `std::multi_lock` member functions that provide this functionality, possibly by using the two proposed free functions.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 36 passes): Additionally, it is probably preferable to keep the interface similar to that of `unique_lock` and `scoped_lock` to complete the family of mutex wrapper classes with a consistent design.
