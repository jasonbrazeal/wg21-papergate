Verdict: Strong (9/14)

The paper gives a reasonably concrete picture of existing use and implementation support for relaxing the `<random>` restrictions on narrow character types, but it leaves the standardization rationale largely implicit. The strongest material concerns real-world code and library extensions, while the thinnest part is the absence of a direct argument for why this change belongs in the standard rather than remaining a common extension.

- The paper establishes that thousands of existing files already use `uniform_int_distribution` with types such as `uint8_t`, showing both demand and de facto practice.
- It also establishes implementation experience through libc++ and libstdc++ extensions, including specific support for `signed char` and `unsigned char`.
- The most glaring omission is that the paper does not establish why the standard itself must change, as opposed to relying on the documented extensions already available in major implementations.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Use of `signed char` or `unsigned char` in `<random>` currently results in undefined behavior.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): The ability to generate random bytes or octets is extremely valuable for fuzz testing.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 24 passes): The current restriction which forbids `unsigned char` is bad, but it's not obvious how much the restriction should be relaxed.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 24 passes): In 2013, [[LWG2326]](https://cplusplus%2egithub%2eio/LWG/issue2326) `uniform_int_distribution<unsigned char>` should be permitted stated that it's just silly that we have a random number library with no natural way to generate random bytes.
