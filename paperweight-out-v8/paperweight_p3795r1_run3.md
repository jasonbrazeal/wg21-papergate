Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a thin, largely asserted rationale for standardization, resting on general claims about usefulness and inconsistencies among recently adopted APIs. It does not identify who is affected, explain why the standard is the right venue, or show that a library solution would be inadequate. The most substantial support is the observation that related facilities were adopted together and introduced inconsistencies, but even that is not developed into a concrete case.

- The strongest support is the claim that independently adopted papers created gaps and inconsistent APIs, which at least gestures toward a coordination problem.
- The paper asserts the information is useful and occasionally requested, but does not demonstrate the need or the affected users.
- The paper offers no evidence of implementation experience, prior art, or alternatives beyond the vague reference to inconsistencies.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any argument for why this belongs in the standard rather than in a library.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): Given that this is a useful (and occasionally asked for) piece of information, we should just provide it directly, rather than having this API proliferate.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 18 passes): Because these were all (somewhat) independent papers that were adopted at the same time, there were a few inconsistencies that were introduced.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 18 passes): there were a few inconsistencies that were introduced. Some gaps in coverage. Some inconsistent APIs.
