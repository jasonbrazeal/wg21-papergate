Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers some suggestive motivation and a plausible implementation sketch, but it leaves most of the case for standardization unargued, particularly around who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, and how the feature would coordinate with existing or forthcoming reflection facilities.

- The strongest support is the observation that structural types appear in normative library requirements while users have no direct way to query that property.
- The paper gestures at prior art and alternatives through P2996 and a sample implementation, but does not actually compare approaches or show why the proposed query is preferable.
- The paper does not establish who is affected by the absence of the trait, leaving the practical audience and impact unclear.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any argument for why this belongs in the standard rather than in a library or as part of the existing reflection work.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The *is_structural_type check* is valuable wherever values (including small user-defined structs) have to be treated as compile‑time constants, since NTTPs must be structural types.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): yet there is no way to query whether a type is structural.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996, such as *is_constexpr(info),* *is_literal_type(info)* and *is_lambda_closure_type(info).*
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): Several parts of the standard and library refer to structural types, including library mandates that types be structural, yet there is no way to query whether a type is structural.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): We provide a sample implementation using other reflection metafunctions from P2996 to demonstrate how far we can go with the existing batch of reflection type queries included in C++26.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): [P2996](http://wg21.link/P2996) introduced several metafunctions *(consteval* functions that operate on *meta::info)* in *&lt;meta>* that mirror existing type traits, such as *is_const_type(info), is_volatile_type(info),* and *is_trivially_copyable_type(info).*
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996, such as *is_constexpr(info),* *is_literal_type(info)* and *is_lambda_closure_type(info).*
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): The approach of using reflection metafunctions to query type attributes appears promising, and likely to yield richer APIs than possible with prior techniques.

candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): The code below shows a possible implementation of *is_structural_type,* using Bloomberg’s Clang fork.
