Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper’s strongest, and essentially only fully realized, support comes from implementation experience, where it can point to concrete behavior in a reference implementation, libunifex, and stdexec. Beyond that, the case for standardization rests largely on repeated assertions about existing practice and user concern, without enough surrounding evidence to turn those claims into a persuasive argument. The thinnest areas are the basic motivating questions—why the change matters, who is affected, and why it belongs in the standard rather than in a library—where the paper leans on the same brief references rather than developing the rationale.

- The paper establishes implementation experience most convincingly, citing observable behavior in a reference implementation and adoption in libunifex and stdexec.
- Prior art and alternatives are established through references to the relevant specification section and existing implementations.
- The weakest support is for why the standard itself must change, since the paper repeatedly invokes libunifex’s practice without showing why that practice cannot remain outside the standard.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Despite the elegance of the above-described analogues there is one area in which they lack predictive power: The lifetime of the operation state.

candidate 2 (found by 1 of 39 passes): libunifex does not exhibit this behavior and several individuals have expressed concern
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 39 passes): Also note that the implementation of the `let_*` family of algorithms in libunifex already uses the above-described lifetime management strategy [11], and therefore adopting this change would be standardizing existing practice.
