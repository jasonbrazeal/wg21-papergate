Verdict: Adequate to Strong (8/14)

The paper offers solid support for the existence and importance of the compound-result problem, and it credibly shows that current sender-based approaches are more verbose and fragmented than coroutine-based ones. The case thins considerably when the paper turns to why this needs standardization rather than a library solution, and it never establishes what the standard should actually say.

- The strongest support is for why the problem matters: the paper clearly shows that compound results are a real systems pattern and that senders and coroutines handle them at different abstraction floors.
- The prior-art section is also well grounded, demonstrating that multiple sender constructions exist and that generic algorithms do not address value-based dispatch.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established argument for why standardization, as opposed to a library, is necessary or appropriate.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 54 passes): Both coroutines and senders destroy compound data at an abstraction floor - the difference is that the sender floor sits below the composition algebra, and the coroutine floor is opt-in.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The compound-result pattern is how systems report outcomes when the result carries more than a boolean.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 54 passes): When a sender-based I/O operation completes, it must choose a channel. The byte count and the status code - which the OS delivered as a pair - are now split
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The coroutine version has one construction. The equivalence is in what the code does, not in what the programmer must know to write it.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 54 passes): Krzemieński's question was direct: given a value on the value channel, how do I route it to different channels at runtime?
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The three-channel model is correct for this class. `std::execution` serves it well.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The four sender implementations each use a different construction (`variant_sender`, `any_sender_of`, `execution::task`, custom sender), and a programmer encountering the problem for the first time must evaluate all four before choosing.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The generic algorithms - `retry`, `when_all`, `upon_error` - do not participate. They were designed for channel-based dispatch, not value-based dispatch.
