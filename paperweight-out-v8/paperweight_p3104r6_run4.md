Verdict: Strong (9/14)

The paper offers solid support in the areas of prior art, the need for a standard mechanism, and implementation experience, but its case is much thinner when it comes to showing who is affected, why the operations matter in practice, and why a library cannot suffice. The most glaring absence is any discussion of coordination and interoperability with other standards or implementations.

- The strongest support comes from concrete implementation experience, including compiler output and a reference implementation.
- The paper also establishes that existing practice and published algorithms provide a foundation for the proposed operations.
- The argument for why a standard facility is needed rests on the inability of ISO C++ to exploit optimization-time information, though this is asserted rather than demonstrated.
- The paper does not address coordination and interoperability at all, leaving a significant gap in the standardization case.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): However, there are still a few operations which are non-trivial to implement in software and have widely available hardware support.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 36 passes): Bit-reversal, repetition, compression, and expansion are fundamental operations that meet multiple criteria which make them suitable for standardization:
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 36 passes): The utility functions in `<bit>` are not meant to provide a full bitwise manipulation library, but fundamental operations, especially those that can be accelerated in hardware while still having reasonable software fallbacks.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 36 passes): Both operations can be described with `extract` and `deposit` terminology, making it virtually useless for keeping the operations apart.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): It is worth noting that clang provides a cross-platform family of intrinsics. [`__builtin_bitreverse`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#builtin-bitreverse) uses byte-swapping or bit-reversal instructions if possible.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The use of `compress` and `expand` is consistent with the mask-based permutations for `std::simd` proposed in [P2664R6].
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): [Warren1] presents algorithms which are the basis for [Schultke1].
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): The C++ bit manipulation library in `<bit>` is an invaluable abstraction from hardware operations.
