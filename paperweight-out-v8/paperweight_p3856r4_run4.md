Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper gives a solid account of why a structural-type query would be useful and demonstrates that it can be implemented with existing reflection facilities, but it leaves several parts of the standardization case largely unargued. The thinnest support concerns who specifically needs this in the standard library, why standardization is preferable to a library-only solution, and how the feature would coordinate with existing or proposed reflection APIs.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, including a working sample on Bloomberg’s Clang fork and a Godbolt link.
- The paper clearly establishes the motivating need by pointing out that structural types are required for NTTPs but cannot currently be queried.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is present but underdeveloped, since it gestures at comparisons and missing P2996 metafunctions without fully establishing the trade-offs.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established argument for who is affected or why the standard, rather than a library, is the right vehicle.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The *is_structural_type check* is valuable wherever values (including small user-defined structs) have to be treated as compile‑time constants, since NTTPs must be structural types.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): yet there is no way to query whether a type is structural.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): yet there is no way to query whether a type is structural

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): In addition, we compare the approaches of using traditional type traits vs. using reflection metafunctions to query type attributes.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): It also shows the need for more “lower level” metafunctions not included in P2996, such as *is_constexpr(info),* *is_literal_type(info)* and *is_lambda_closure_type(info).*
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): [P2996](http://wg21.link/P2996) introduced several metafunctions *(consteval* functions that operate on *meta::info)* in *<meta>* that mirror existing type traits, such as *is_const_type(info), is_volatile_type(info),* and *is_trivially_copyable_type(info).*

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): We provide a sample implementation using other reflection metafunctions from P2996 to demonstrate how far we can go with the existing batch of reflection type queries included in C++26.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Our experience in implementing new reflection metafunctions shows how reflection type queries can be implemented using other reflection metafunctions only (no intrinsics or SFINAE).
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): The code below shows a possible implementation of *is_structural_type,* using Bloomberg’s Clang fork.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): The code below shows a possible implementation of *is_structural_type,* using Bloomberg’s Clang fork. [Godbolt link](https://godbolt.org/z/abGPKx1YM)
