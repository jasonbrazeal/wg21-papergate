Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers only a narrow basis for its own standardization: it demonstrates that the proposed change exists in a reference implementation, but it does not establish who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, or how the change would coordinate with the broader ecosystem. The thinnest support is around the core justification for standardization, where the paper repeatedly asserts a performance problem without showing its scope, alternatives, or the limits of a library-only solution.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, since the proposed solution is already present in the `std::execution` reference implementation as of early 2026.
- The paper claims, but does not establish, why the matter is important, relying on a single example of lost parallelization when `task_scheduler` wraps `parallel_scheduler`.
- The paper does not establish who is affected by the issue, leaving the audience and impact of the proposed change unclear.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any case for why the standard should address this rather than a library, along with no discussion of coordination or interoperability.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): if a `task_scheduler` wraps a `parallel_scheduler` and is used to launch parallel work with a `bulk` sender, the work is not parallelized as it would be had a `parallel_scheduler` been used directly.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 21 passes): Currently, `task_scheduler` is specified to have an exposition-only member *`sch_`* of type `shared_ptr&lt;void>`. If this is changed to `shared_ptr&lt;parallel_scheduler_backend>`, then the `bulk` algorithms can dispatch through `*`sch_`*->schedule_bulk_chunked(...)` and `*`sch_`*->schedule_bulk_unchunked(...)` and be accelerated for free.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Like `task_scheduler`, the `parallel_scheduler` is a type-erased wrapper for a scheduler-like object.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): This paragraph is taken from [[P3941R3]](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P3941R3.html).
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): if a `task_scheduler` wraps a `parallel_scheduler` and is used to launch parallel work with a `bulk` sender, the work is not parallelized as it would be had a `parallel_scheduler` been used directly.
