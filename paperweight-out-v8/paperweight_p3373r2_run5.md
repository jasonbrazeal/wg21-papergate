Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper offers a mixed case for its own standardization, with solid grounding in prior art and implementation experience but little persuasive argument for why the change matters, who it affects, or why a library solution would be insufficient. The strongest support comes from concrete evidence that the proposed lifetime strategy is already implemented in existing libraries, while the thinnest support appears in the repeated reliance on a single claim about existing practice to carry several distinct burdens of justification.

- The paper clearly establishes prior art and implementation experience, citing both libunifex and nVidia’s stdexec as existing adopters of the proposed lifetime management strategy.
- The argument for why the standard should adopt this change rests almost entirely on the assertion that existing implementations already do it, which is credited for the “why the standard” question but not for several others.
- The paper does not establish who is affected by the change beyond the implementers themselves, leaving the user-facing impact largely unexamined.
- The most glaring omission is the failure to establish why a library will not do, since the paper’s own evidence of existing library implementations undercuts rather than supports the need for standardization.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): This paper proposes changes to the lifetime of the operation states [1] of sub operations of `std::execution::let_value`, `::let_error`, and `::let_stopped`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Note that `repeat_effect_until` is not part of `std::execution` as of this writing but is provided as an extension by the reference implementation [5] which was used in the preparation of this paper.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): The implementation in libunifex [6] does exactly this as of the time of this writing.
