Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper makes a reasonably clear case that defaulted postfix operators would address a real, if modest, boilerplate problem and that standardization is the appropriate venue rather than a library mixin or a rewrite rule. The strongest support concerns the problem statement and the rationale for choosing a language feature over the alternatives, while the thinnest parts are the absence of implementation experience and the largely asserted claims about who would benefit and how existing libraries would coordinate.

- The paper establishes why the feature matters by pointing to the canonical definition of postfix increment and the concrete shadowing problem that requires `using` declarations.
- It also establishes why the standard is the right place, since a standardized default could shrink library specifications and avoid competing library-specific mixins.
- The claims about affected users and interoperability with existing libraries are plausible but not backed by evidence beyond the authors’ own survey or speculation.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any implementation experience, leaving the practical viability of the proposed defaulting mechanism unverified.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Postfix increment and decrement operators have a near-universal canonical definition.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): This reduces boilerplate code while still expressing the universally-known meaning of the function.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 39 passes): Every parent class which inherits from incrementable must explicitly make the postfix operator visible with a using expression, as the prefix operator in my_class shadows the postfix in incrementable.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 39 passes): The issue with a rewrite rule is that increment and decrement operators are not as suitable for implicit operations as equality and comparison ones.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 39 passes): The majority of classes written with postfix operations can now simply default them and get an operator which does the right thing.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 39 passes): The authors have identified 53 candidate operations which could be defaulted and remain semantically equivalent to their current behaviour, and have written [P3785] to explore defaulting them.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): It is worth noting that there has been a persistent interest in saving user boilerplate when defining operator overloads with canonical definitions, such as speculated on in [P0436].
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): It was intentionally decided not to add a feature test macro for this proposal, as it would have minimal benefit.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): One alternative we considered for this change would be a rewrite rule, similar to the C++20 equality and comparison operator changes, such that `a++` could generate a rewritten candidate equivalent to `[&a]{auto copy{a}; ++a; return copy;}()`.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 39 passes): We do not believe that there is any incompatibility between this paper and P3662.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Standardising a "default" behaviour for postfix operations would also allow us to shrink the library specification, by expressing operations which are specified to be equivalent to the canonical implementation as being default.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): The issue with a rewrite rule is that increment and decrement operators are not as suitable for implicit operations as equality and comparison ones.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 39 passes): There is also benefit in standardising the way to retrieve this default - multiple libraries might all ship their own `incrementable` or `postfix_increment()` variants, which may make slightly different design choices.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 39 passes): multiple libraries might all ship their own `incrementable` or `postfix_increment()` variants, which may make slightly different design choices.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 39 passes): Mixins open the door to potentially confusing semantics, such as my_class being pointer-interconvertible with incrementable
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 39 passes): This approach is opt-out, rather than opt-in, with every copyable and prefix-incrementable class automatically gaining postfix operations whether they make sense or not; and so opens the door to additional surprise features.
