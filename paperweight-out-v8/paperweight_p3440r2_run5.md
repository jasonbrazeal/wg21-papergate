Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers solid support for the usefulness of the function and for the existence of reasonable alternatives, but much of the case for putting it in the standard rests on assertions about implementation quality and portability that are not backed up with evidence. The thinnest parts concern why a library solution is insufficient and what concrete implementation experience demonstrates.

- The strongest support is the clear explanation of why the function matters for loop remainders and why manual mask generation is error-prone.
- The paper also establishes that alternatives exist and that a free function fits the design principles of `std::simd`.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of demonstrated evidence that a non-standard library implementation cannot adequately solve the problem.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Such a function is notably useful for handling loop remainders.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Manual mask generation introduces subtle correctness issues for corner cases.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 21 passes): It makes generating efficient mask remainders across all Intel targets efficient and easy, and it makes the code’s intent very obvious.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 21 passes): The absence of preconditions on empty or full cases enables simple, uniform code that mirrors the usage of `partial_load`

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Intel’s implementation of `std::simd` has had this function (albeit as a named constructor) since very early on, and it is used throughout our example code base.

  [7] 5. Wording                                   0/0/0  -> 0.00
candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Without `mask_from_count`, there are several ways to create that mask, three variants of which are illustrated here:
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Following `std::simd`’s design principle, all operations that can be free functions are free functions.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Intel’s implementation of `std::simd` has had this function (albeit as a named constructor) since very early on, and it is used throughout our example code base.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): By making this function part of `std::simd` itself, the implementation can choose the most efficient implementation for the target and correctly handle all possible corner cases

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The integer bit-manipulation approach only works if the integer type is large enough - using a `uint16_t` value to generate a 64-bit mask will silently fail on some targets.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Intel’s implementation experience shows no notable performance difference between implementations that handle all non-negative counts versus those with stricter preconditions.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Intel’s implementation of `std::simd` has had this function (albeit as a named constructor) since very early on, and it is used throughout our example code base.
