Verdict: Strong (9/14)

The paper offers solid grounding in implementation experience and a clear account of the problem it wants to solve, but its case for standardization rests heavily on assertions about prevalence and ABI needs that are not backed up in the text. The thinnest part is the absence of any argument for why a library solution outside the standard would be insufficient.

- The strongest support comes from concrete implementation experience, including a proof-of-concept implementation, range-v3 precedent, and benchmark data.
- The paper clearly establishes why type erasure for views matters, particularly for API boundaries where copying into a vector is a common workaround.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is well developed, showing how `any_view` relates to `std::span` and existing range-v3 design choices.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any established reason that a standard library facility is necessary rather than a standalone library.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): In large applications, such liberal use of `std::ranges` can lead to increased header dependencies and often a significant compilation time penalty.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): In Wrocław meeting, one important point was made: The majority of the use case of `any_view` is to use it as a function parameter in the API boundary.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Due to the lack of type erasure utilities, typically the API takes a `vector`, even though the implementation only needs to iterate once over the elements.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 33 passes): We maintain that this code pattern is very common in the wild: making the code simple and clean at the cost of copying data, even though most of the callers don’t actually need a copy of the data at all.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 33 passes): In Hagenberg, SG9 recommended to make it move-only by default with the votes: | SF | F | N | A | SA | | 4 | 5 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 33 passes): `any_view` has been implemented in [[range-v3]](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3), with equivalent semantics as proposed here.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): `std::span<T>` is another type-erasure utility recently added to the standard; and is closely related to ranges in fact, by allowing type-erased *reference* of any underlying *contiguous* range of objects.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This is inspired by Barry’s [blog post](https://brevzin.github.io/c++/2019/12/02/named-arguments/).
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): `range-v3` uses the name `category` for the category enumeration type. However, the authors believe that the name `std::ranges::category` is too general and it should be reserved for more general purpose utility in ranges library.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 33 passes): `any_view` has been implemented in [[range-v3]](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3), with equivalent semantics as proposed here.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 33 passes): In this paper, we propose to extend the standard library with `std::ranges::any_view`, which provides a convenient and generalized type-erasure facility to hold any object of any type that satisfies the `ranges::view` concept itself.
