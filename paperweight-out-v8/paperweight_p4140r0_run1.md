Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers only a narrow slice of the case for its own standardization: it explains the historical accident it is correcting and shows awareness of the prior formulation, but it leaves most of the burden unaddressed. The thinnest areas are the absence of any account of who is affected, why a library solution would not suffice, or what implementation experience exists.

- The strongest support is the explanation that an explicit allowance for incomplete types was inadvertently dropped and that this paper restores it.
- The paper also establishes prior art by noting the earlier definition in terms of Cpp17BinaryTypeTrait and the reason it was changed.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any discussion of who is affected by the change or why the standard is the right place to address it.

## END SUMMARY

## motivation - grade 2.00 (fired in 1 of 1 sections, strong in 1)
under each rule: top2 2.00   corroborated 2.00   accumulate 2.00   max 2.00
votes by section:
  [1] (front matter: title, abstract and anythi... 2/2/2  -> 2.00
candidate 1 (found by 3 of 3 passes): During that change, the explicit allowance for `type_order<X, Y>` being defined for incomplete `X` or `Y` got inadvertently dropped, so this paper re-introduces that allowance.

## audience - grade 0.00 (fired in 0 of 1 sections, strong in 0)

## prior_art - grade 2.00 (fired in 1 of 1 sections, strong in 1)

votes by section:
  [1] (front matter: title, abstract and anythi... 2/2/2  -> 2.00
candidate 1 (found by 3 of 3 passes): It used to be defined in terms of Cpp17BinaryTypeTrait, but changed this in P3778R0 due to std::strong_ordering not being a structural type.
