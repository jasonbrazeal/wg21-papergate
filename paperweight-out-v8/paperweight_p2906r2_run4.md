Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers some useful support for its standardization case, particularly around prior art, implementation experience, and the value of preserving compile-time extents, but it leaves several essential parts of the argument unaddressed. The thinnest areas are the lack of any identified affected users, the absence of coordination or interoperability discussion, and only asserted—rather than demonstrated—reasons why the standard or a library solution cannot suffice.

- The strongest support is the concrete implementation experience, with a working example using current libstdc++/libc++ trunk and C++26.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives clearly, including the adopted structured-binding pack feature and the current ill-formedness of destructuring `std::extents`.
- The most glaring omission is that the paper never establishes who is affected by the problem or why their needs should drive standardization.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Demoting static extents to runtime values would be lossy, with no way for user code to recover the compile-time nature afterwards.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): This alternative is simpler to specify, but that simplicity is bought by discarding the compile-time information that the user encoded in the static extents, with no way for user code to recover it.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 30 passes): A notable missing feature are structured bindings, which would come in handy if the extents of the individual dimensions need to be extracted:
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 30 passes): However, `std::extents` behaves very little like an array. A notable missing feature are structured bindings, which would come in handy if the extents of the individual dimensions need to be extracted:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): [[P1061R10]](https://wg21.link/p1061r10) (adopted into C++26), which allows structured bindings to introduce a pack
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Destructuring `std::extents` in the current specification [[N4944]](https://wg21.link/n4944) is ill-formed, because `std::extents` stores its runtime extents in a private non-static data member, which is inaccessible to structured bindings.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 30 passes): An example of such an implementation using libstdc++/libc++ trunk’s implementation of `<mdspan>` with `-std=c++26` on Godbolt is provided here: [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/dYocKf8cs).
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 30 passes): This alternative is simpler to specify, but that simplicity is bought by discarding the compile-time information that the user encoded in the static extents, with no way for user code to recover it.
