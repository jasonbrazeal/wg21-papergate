Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers a reasonably grounded case for the language change in its motivation, prior art, and implementation experience, but it leaves several essential standardization arguments asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest support concerns who is affected, coordination with existing practice, and why a library solution cannot suffice.

- The strongest support is the concrete compiler implementation and its reported ease, which shows the change is feasible in practice.
- The paper also establishes clear motivation by showing how current lambda rules conflict with const-correct callable libraries and ordinary expectations of logical constness.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any identified user community or concrete affected codebase, leaving the actual demand for the feature unestablished.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Taken together, this means the above standard types, and *any* other const-correct callable library, *cannot* work with logically const lambdas in the current form.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Lambdas in such cases require workarounds, such as abandoning logical const correctness, abandoning ownership, or introducing intermediary {non-}const-propagating types.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 36 passes): There seems to be a commonly shared feeling that there is a simpler language hiding in C++, and that the lambda syntax should be orthogonal to all the other ways of declaring callable types, not a microcosm unto itself.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Capturing by `const` reference is nonetheless useful – for read-only access to an object too large to copy – and today requires `std::cref` or `std::as_const`, which is not as concise, intuitive, or discoverable as `const&`.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): There seems to be a commonly shared feeling that there is a simpler language hiding in C++, and that the lambda syntax should be orthogonal to all the other ways of declaring callable types, not a microcosm unto itself.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): P3963 (approved by EWG) restores it for ordinary captures; a const capture then correctly opts back out – exactly as a `const` member of a hand-written callable would.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): The alternative is to simply leave otherwise const captures modifiable, or to use `std::cref`.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): An *init-capture* instead behaves “as if it declares … a variable of the form `auto` *init-capture* `;`” ([[expr.prim.lambda.capture] paragraph 6](https://eel.is/c++draft/expr.prim.lambda.capture#6), N3610, N3648), so its type is deduced by `auto`, which strips top-level cv-qualifiers and references.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 36 passes): We are not proposing a new model of lambdas; we are completing one the language has converged on since C++11 – letting the programmer spell the `const` and `mutable` members the desugared function object could always have held.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 36 passes): Taken together, this means the above standard types, and *any* other const-correct callable library, *cannot* work with logically const lambdas in the current form.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 36 passes): The standard specifies the closure as a class.
