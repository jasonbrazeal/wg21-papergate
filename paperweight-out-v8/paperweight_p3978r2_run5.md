Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers some useful grounding for its proposal, particularly through implementation experience and references to related work, but it leaves several essential parts of the standardization case unaddressed. The thinnest areas concern who is actually affected, why this belongs in the standard rather than a library, and how the change would coordinate with existing practice.

- The strongest support comes from the author’s shipping implementation and testing on GCC trunk with libstdc++.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives by comparing its wording to earlier revisions and related wrapper proposals.
- The rationale for standardization is weakened by the absence of any account of who is affected by the inconsistency.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any argument for why a library solution cannot address the problem, or why the standard itself must change.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 27 passes): As discussed in [P3948R0], because of language inconsistencies, std::constant_wrapper is inconsistently not unwrapping for call and subscript operators whereas all other operators can be found via ADL and the conversion operator implemented in constant_wrapper.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): We should reconsider the placement of `constant_wrapper` in `&lt;type_traits>`.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): because of language inconsistencies, std::constant_wrapper is inconsistently not unwrapping for call and subscript operators whereas all other operators can be found via ADL and the conversion operator implemented in constant_wrapper.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The most glaring question on this issue is why would we do this for `operator()` and `operator[]` but for none of the other operators. This seems inconsistent.

candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): With this paper, `constant_wrapper` almost achieves parity with what was proposed for `fn_t` / `function_wrapper` by Schultke et al. [P3774R0] and Müller [P3843R2].
