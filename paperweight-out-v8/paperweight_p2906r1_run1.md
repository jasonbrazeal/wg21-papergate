Verdict: Strong (9/14)

The paper offers a reasonably grounded case for the existence of a portability and usability problem around decomposing `std::extents`, and it shows that the issue is real in current practice. Its support is thinnest, however, when it moves from identifying the problem to justifying standardization as the necessary remedy, since the affected audience, the limits of a library-only solution, and the interoperability consequences are asserted rather than demonstrated.

- The strongest support comes from the concrete demonstration that existing implementations can already expose structured bindings accidentally, making the current behavior non-portable and tied to representation details.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is also well supported, particularly the contrast with `std::mdspan`/`std::extents` history and the acknowledged trade-off of demoting static extents to runtime values.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established description of who is affected by the problem, leaving the scope and practical urgency of the proposed change unclear.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Providing a tuple interface gives users one portable decomposition over the logical extents and prevents code from depending on the wrong representation.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Demoting static extents to runtime values would be lossy, with no way for user code to recover the compile-time nature afterwards.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 30 passes): This alternative is simpler to specify, but that simplicity is bought by discarding the compile-time information that the user encoded in the static extents, with no way for user code to recover it.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 30 passes): Comparing before and after, the usability gain with structured bindings alone is marginal, but it allows us to use descriptive names for the extents to improve readability.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): [[P0009R18]](https://wg21.link/p0009r18) proposed `std::mdspan` , which was approved for C++23. It comes with the utility class template `std::extents` to describe the integral extents of a multidimensional index space.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Some implementations nevertheless happen to accept structured bindings for `std::extents` due to representation details. Such bindings decompose the object representation, not the logical extents.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 30 passes): An example of such an implementation using GCC trunk’s implementation of `<mdspan>` with `-std=c++26` on Godbolt is provided here: [https://godbolt.org/z/sfMa5zEd5](https://godbolt.org/z/sfMa5zEd5).
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 30 passes): This alternative is simpler to specify, but that simplicity is bought by discarding the compile-time information that the user encoded in the static extents, with no way for user code to recover it.
