Verdict: Adequate to Strong (8/14)

The paper offers some concrete implementation evidence and identifies relevant prior art, but its broader case for standardization rests heavily on repeated assertions about existing practice rather than demonstrated need, impact, or interoperability. The thinnest support is in explaining why a library solution is insufficient and in showing who is actually affected by the current behavior.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, with multiple implementations cited as already using or adopting the proposed lifetime strategy.
- The paper establishes prior art by pointing to specific sections of the existing specification and to libunifex’s behavior.
- The case for why the standard must change leans on the claim that this would standardize existing practice, but it does not show why that practice cannot remain a library-level convention.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any argument for why a library will not do, leaving the necessity of standardization essentially unaddressed.
