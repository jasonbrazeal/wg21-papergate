Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers some concrete support for its standardization case, chiefly through a reference implementation and a clear motivating example, but it leaves several essential justifications almost entirely unaddressed. The thinnest areas are the arguments for why this belongs in the standard, why a library solution is insufficient, and how the feature would coordinate with existing or future specifications.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, with the proposal already integrated into the `stdexec` reference implementation.
- The paper also establishes a clear motivating problem by showing how `task_scheduler` wrapping a `parallel_scheduler` fails to preserve parallelization for `bulk` senders.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is grounded in the relationship to `parallel_scheduler` and the cited predecessor paper P3941R3.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established argument for why standardization, rather than a library, is necessary or appropriate.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): if a `task_scheduler` wraps a `parallel_scheduler` and is used to launch parallel work with a `bulk` sender, the work is not parallelized as it would be had a `parallel_scheduler` been used directly.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): These are precisely the operations we would like `task_scheduler` to handle.

candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Like `task_scheduler`, the `parallel_scheduler` is a type-erased wrapper for a scheduler-like object.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 21 passes): This implementation also integrates the changes proposed by [[P3941R3]](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P3941R3.html).
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 21 passes): This paragraph is taken from [[P3941R3]](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P3941R3.html).
