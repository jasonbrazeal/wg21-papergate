Verdict: Weak (2/14)

The paper offers only a narrow, asserted rationale for why allocator propagation matters, and it leaves most of the surrounding case for standardization unaddressed. The support is thinnest where a proposal normally needs to show that the problem belongs in the standard, that a library solution is insufficient, and that the design has been exercised in practice.

- The strongest support is the paper’s claim that the current `task` design forces allocator specification at the launch site and thereby prevents transparent propagation through coroutine call trees.
- The discussion of prior art gestures at a trade-off with `allocator_arg`, but it does not establish that the proposed direction is necessary or that alternatives have been seriously evaluated.
- The paper does not establish who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, or how the feature would coordinate with existing coroutine and sender machinery.
- Most glaringly, there is no implementation experience, no library-only analysis, and no demonstrated interoperability story to ground the standardization request.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 18 passes): task does not allow the user to specify an allocator at the launch site for coroutine frame allocation.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 18 passes): Shipping without propagation locks in a design where every launch site must specify its allocator explicitly, foreclosing transparent propagation through the coroutine call tree.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 18 passes): task does not allow the user to specify an allocator at the launch site for coroutine frame allocation. The coroutine frame is allocated by operator new at the call site, before any sender connect / start machinery runs.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): The authors developed P4007R0[2] (“Senders and Coroutines”). The classification below holds regardless of whether any alternative design exists.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 18 passes): The `allocator_arg` mechanism in [P3552R3](https://wg21.link/p3552r3)[1] works around this by requiring the allocator in the coroutine’s parameter list, but that locks in a caller-specified approach and forecloses environment-based injection.
