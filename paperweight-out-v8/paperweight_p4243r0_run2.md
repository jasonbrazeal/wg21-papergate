Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow justification for its proposed change, centered on a claim of mathematical incorrectness, and leaves most of the case for standardization unaddressed. The thinnest areas are the absence of any discussion of who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, or whether a library-level solution could suffice.

- The strongest support is the paper’s assertion that the current `views::zip()` behavior is mathematically incorrect, which at least identifies a motivating defect.
- The paper cites prior art from range-v3 via P2321R2, but does not establish that this precedent supports the proposed change rather than merely explaining the status quo.
- The paper does not identify any affected users or use cases, leaving the practical impact of the problem entirely unstated.
- The paper offers no implementation experience, no interoperability or coordination analysis, and no argument for why this cannot be handled outside the standard.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): This paper proposes a fix that makes the `views::zip()` ill-formed instead of the current `views::empty<tuple<>>`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 18 passes): The current `views::empty<tuple<>>` is mathematically incorrect.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): According to [[P2321R2]](https://wg21.link/p2321r2), the reason for the current behaviour of `zip()` was: > As in range-v3, zipping nothing produces an `empty_view` of the appropriate type.
