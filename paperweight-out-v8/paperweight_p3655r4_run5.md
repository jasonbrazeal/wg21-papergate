Verdict: Strong (11/14)

The paper offers substantial evidence that a null-terminated string view type is widely used, independently implemented, and relevant to common C and C++ interoperation needs. Its weakest area is the absence of a direct argument for why a standard library type is necessary rather than a widely shared vocabulary type outside the standard.

- The strongest support comes from documented, growing use of cstring_view and zstring_view across major and minor codebases, including implementations from Microsoft and Google.
- The paper also establishes clear prior art and coordination concerns, including an earlier standardization attempt and an adjoint proposal affecting std::string::subview.
- The most glaring omission is that the paper never establishes why an in-standard type is required when the type already exists and spreads successfully as a library type.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): We propose a standard string view type that guarantees null-termination.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Because of a lack of a desirable option for passing non-owned null-terminated strings, std::string_view parameters are none the less sometimes used today in cases where null-terminated strings are needed, calling std::string_view::data to get a const char*.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): As such, we do believe that there is both space for such a type, and a desire from multiple angles to have it defined in the standard library.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Many functions right now whether C++ standard library calls, operating system calls, or third-party library calls require null-terminated C-style strings.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Its wide presence on Github with implementations from among others Microsoft, Google, and many smaller projects, indicates a wide support for the type.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): There is an adjoint paper (P3862) that proposes to fix this in the existing-but-unpublished C++26 standard to avoid future deviation in having std::string::subview return string_view for subview(n).
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The paper proposes cstring_view, as it has minor number advantage in every measurement so far.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 27 passes): An attempt was made in Feb 2019 to concretely propose the type (renamed to cstring_view) with http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1402r0.pdf, but it failed to gain consensus in LEWGI at https://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21kona2019/P1402.
