Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers a narrow but genuine case for changing how `signed char` and `unsigned char` are streamed, grounded in surprise, existing workarounds, and precedent from `std::format`. Beyond that motivating core, however, the support for standardization is very thin: the document does not identify who is affected, why this belongs in the standard rather than a library, how it coordinates with other specifications, or whether anyone has implemented the change.

- The strongest support is the established claim that current stream behavior is surprising and that `std::format` already treats these character types as integers, showing a clear precedent.
- The paper also establishes some prior art and alternatives by referencing the C++20 change to `operator>>` signatures and the distinction between C’s `char8_t` alias and C++’s distinct type.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established implementation experience, leaving no evidence that the proposed change has been tried in practice.
- Equally missing is any established case for why the standard is the right venue or why a library solution would not suffice, which leaves the standardization rationale largely unargued.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): This behavior is unexpected, especially when using the aliases `int8_t` or `uint8_t`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): This is surprising.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): It’s difficult to find examples where this is the sought-after behavior, and would become deprecated with this change.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): It’s easy to find counter-examples, however, where workarounds have to be employed to insert or extract `signed char`s or `unsigned char`s as integers.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): `std::format` has already taken a step in the right direction here, by treating `signed char` and `unsigned char` as integers.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): The signature of `operator>>` for `basic_istream` was updated for C++20 in [P0487R1], where these functions were changed to take `T (&)[N]` instead of `T*`, for safety reasons.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): It should be noted, that the C standard has defined `char8_t` to be an alias (typedef) to `unsigned char`. In C++, `char8_t` is a distinct type with an underlying type of `unsigned char`.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): This wording is relative to [N5032].
