Verdict: Strong (11/14)

The paper offers solid support for the core problem and the need for a standard solution, particularly in its discussion of prior art, interoperability, and the mismatch between existing intrinsic practice and the current `std::simd` specification. The case is thinnest where it relies on asserted industry experience and implementation practice without concrete evidence or named codebases beyond a general reference to Intel.

- The strongest support is the clear demonstration that existing vendor intrinsics and `std::array` already provide well-defined bit-reinterpretation, making the current `std::simd` gap a genuine portability regression.
- The paper also convincingly argues that the standard already implies array-like layout through its own “native” concept and intrinsic interop recommendations, so the proposal is filling an internal inconsistency rather than adding a new burden.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of concrete, verifiable evidence for the claimed widespread use and implementation experience, since the affected-user and implementation-experience claims rest on general assertions rather than documented examples or data.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 42 passes): This prevents portable bit reinterpretation idioms that are widely used in SIMD code and supported by existing intrinsic APIs.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 42 passes): Without specifying the layout, such code is not portable across implementations.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 42 passes): This gives users the best of both worlds: zero-overhead portable code for native-width vectors, and a principled way to handle other ABIs without sacrificing generality.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 42 passes): The current state represents a usability regression compared to existing practice with vendor intrinsics, which have always had well-defined bit-casting semantics.

  [14] 12. Future Work                              1/1/1  -> 1.00
candidate 1 (found by 3 of 42 passes): This contrasts with `std::array`, which has a well-specified contiguous layout that makes `bit_cast` operations portable and predictable.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 42 passes): Every target vendor provides these operations with well-defined semantics (e.g., Intel’s `_mm256_castps_si256`, ARM’s `vreinterpretq_s32_f32`).
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 42 passes): | Aspect | Solution 1 (Mandate for `*native-abi*`) | Solution 2 (Query) | Combined |
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 42 passes): The historical evidence is compelling: essentially every major CPU architecture in widespread use over the last 25 years exposes SIMD facilities whose interaction with memory is consistent with array-like element layout, from phones to servers.

  [14] 12. Future Work                              0/0/0  -> 0.00
candidate 1 (found by 3 of 42 passes): The problem is not with flexibility per se, but rather that the exceptional non-standard case penalises the common case of writing portable code.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 42 passes): If intrinsic interop is recommended, then the layout implications of that interop should also be normative; otherwise the recommendation is misleading.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 42 passes): Users migrating from intrinsics to `std::simd` lose this capability because the Working Draft does not specify an object representation that gives portable semantics for such reinterpretation.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 42 passes): The standard already assumes array-like layout for `*native-abi*` through multiple mechanisms: the meaning of "native," the recommended practice for conversions to intrinsics, and the existence of ABI tags for handling variations.
