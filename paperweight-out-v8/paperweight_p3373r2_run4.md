Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper’s strongest support comes from concrete implementation experience, but much of its broader case for standardization rests on repeated assertions rather than developed argument. The thinnest areas are the explanations of who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, and why a library solution would not suffice.

- The paper clearly establishes implementation experience through reference implementations, libunifex, and nVidia’s stdexec.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is well supported by citations to existing practice and extensions.
- The paper repeatedly cites libunifex’s existing strategy as evidence for several distinct standardization needs, but does not expand that single point into a fuller justification for each.
- The most glaring omission is a developed argument for why this change requires standardization rather than remaining a common library extension.
