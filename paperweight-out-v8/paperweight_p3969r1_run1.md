Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper gives a clear account of why the degenerate `std::bit_cast` case is dangerous and why a single-function fix is preferable, but it does not build a complete case for standardization. The strongest material concerns motivation and alternatives, while the discussion of affected users, implementability, and the need for standard rather than library action remains thin or absent.

- The paper convincingly establishes that the current behavior is an unconditional-UB footgun with little user benefit.
- It also provides a credible survey of alternatives, including a more ambitious earlier revision and compiler builtins for clearing padding.
- The claim that the change affects only code already containing unconditional UB is asserted but not supported with evidence about real-world usage.
- The paper does not establish why this requires a standard change rather than a library solution, nor does it offer implementation experience or coordination details.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): This behavior is a footgun, and is not very useful. If users wanted a function that always has UB, they should be writing `std::unreachable`, not `std::bit_cast`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Overall, this design sweeps the problem under the rug with little benefit to the user.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 30 passes): The proposed change only makes the degenerate form of `std::bit_cast` ill-formed, i.e. it raises an error in code that contained unconditional UB.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 30 passes): The single-function solution is problematic because `std::bit_cast` can be used to convert padded types to a byte array without undefined behavior and with zero overhead.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Another case where the degenerate form may arise frequently is bit-casting `_BitInt` (supported by Clang as an extension and proposed in [[P3666R3]](https://wg21%2elink/p3666r3)), considering that most `_BitInt` types (at least 7/8) have padding bits.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): However, R0 of this paper was more ambitious and presented two approaches:
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 30 passes): In the discussion of this proposal prior to publication, it was suggested to clear the padding *before* bit-casting. That is, standardizing [`__builtin_clear_padding`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html#index-_005f_005fbuiltin_005fclear_005fpadding) and using an idiom such as:
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 30 passes): The most straight-forward implementation strategy is to add a check in the compiler's `__builtin_bit_cast` intrinsic for the degenerate form of `std::bit_cast`.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): This would likely mean that `constexpr std::clear_padding` is effectively unimplementable in current compilers.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 30 passes): That makes it possible to implement a proper conversion from `long double` to `__int128`, although it requires multiple steps:
