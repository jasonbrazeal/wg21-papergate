Verdict: Weak to Adequate (3/14)

The paper offers some grounding for why the feature would be useful and how it relates to existing practice, but it leaves the core standardization argument largely unaddressed. The thinnest areas are the absence of evidence about who is affected, why a library solution is insufficient, and whether there is any implementation experience to validate the design.

- The strongest support is the motivation, which credibly explains why interaction with target-specific intrinsics is an inevitable need for `std::simd` users.
- The paper also establishes some prior art and naming alignment with existing `std::simd` facilities such as `chunk` and `cat`.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of any implementation experience, leaving the proposal without practical validation.
- Equally missing is a case for why this cannot be provided as a library rather than through standardization.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Proposal to extend `std::simd` with a method of allowing a lambda to be invoked on smaller pieces of a SIMD value in order to make interaction with intrinsics easier.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): Being able to define a different size is useful for two reasons:
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 21 passes): This requires that the programmer is able to allow a `basic_vec` value to be used in a call to a target intrinsic, and that the result of the intrinsic call can be used to generate a new `basic_vec` value.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): However, it is inevitable that the programmer will want to make some use of target-specific intrinsics in order to unlock some of the more unusual features of those specific platforms.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The function is named `chunked_invoke` and placed in `std::simd` to directly align with related established functions such as `chunk` and `cat`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): The draft standard of `std::simd` recommends that provision is made for conversions to and from implementation defined types.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 21 passes): In the first revision of this paper we proposed that the function which invokes a Callable with an explicit offset should be called with a `_indexed` suffix (e.g., `simd::chunked_invoke_indexed`).
