Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers only a narrow slice of the case needed for standardization, centered on naming history and prior discussion, while leaving most of the burden unaddressed. The support is thinnest around the basic questions of who would use the feature, why it belongs in the standard rather than a library, and whether anyone has actually tried building it.

- The paper does establish that the naming question has real history, including reconsideration of `get` and the rejection of earlier alternatives.
- It also shows awareness of prior art by recording that related proposals and container extensions failed to reach consensus.
- The most glaring omission is any account of who is affected by the problem or what practical need the feature addresses.
- Equally missing is any evidence of implementation experience, interoperability concerns, or a reason the feature cannot be delivered as a library.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Since that time, even the author of P3091 has reconsidered the implications of the name `get`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): The name of the desired operation should reflect that the lookup may take variable time and could return without finding the value being sought; existing instances of `get` in the Library forbid both.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): P3091 offered names `get_optional` and `lookup_optional`, which failed to evoke enthusiasm in Sofia; and `lookup`, which had supporters, but failed to reach consensus.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): The R2 version of this paper additionally proposed adding a similar feature to random-access sequence containers, but such a change failed to garner consensus in LEWG in Brno
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 24 passes): Since that time, even the author of P3091 has reconsidered the implications of the name `get`.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 24 passes): The name `get_optional` mentioned in P3091 is not proposed, for reasons that should be clear.
