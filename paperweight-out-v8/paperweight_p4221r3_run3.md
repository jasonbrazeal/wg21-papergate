Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers a narrow but real foundation for its standardization case: it clearly motivates the absence of a read-only, padding-independent equality check on atomics and identifies the relevant limitations of existing alternatives. The support is thinnest where the proposal reaches beyond that motivation into necessity, affected users, implementation experience, and coordination, none of which are substantiated.

- The strongest support is the established account of why the problem matters, grounded in the lack of a consistent read-only value representation equality mechanism for atomics.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives by distinguishing `compare_load` from `operator==`, `memcmp`, and `compare_exchange`, including its alignment with `compare_exchange` pointer provenance semantics.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established evidence about who is affected, implementation experience, or coordination and interoperability with existing practice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Standard C++ currently lacks a mechanism to perform a consistent, read-only, padding-independent value representation equality check on an atomic object.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Currently, `compare_exchange` is the only mechanism in the standard library capable of consistently evaluating value representation equality in the presence of padding, but it couples this evaluation to a mutating memory write.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): The introduction of `compare_load` provides fundamental concurrency capabilities that cannot be achieved by combining existing standard library facilities
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 33 passes): Unlike `operator==` (which relies on semantic logic), `memcmp` (which unsafely evaluates indeterminate padding bits), and `compare_exchange` (which incurs a hardware write), `compare_load` provides a consistent, read-only mechanism to evaluate value representation equality.
