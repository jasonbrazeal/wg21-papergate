Verdict: Adequate to Strong (8/14)

The paper offers a reasonably grounded case for standardizing defaulted postfix increment and decrement, with its strongest material addressing why the feature matters, what alternatives were considered, and why the standard is the right venue. The support becomes thinner around the affected audience, interoperability, and the limits of library solutions, and there is no implementation experience presented at all.

- The paper establishes a clear motivation by pointing to the near-universal canonical definition of postfix operators and the boilerplate they currently require.
- It also makes a solid standards case by explaining why a rewrite rule is unsuitable and why standardizing a default would reduce divergent library designs.
- The discussion of who is affected rests mainly on a broad claim about “the majority of classes” rather than concrete evidence or examples.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any implementation experience, leaving the practical viability of the proposed wording and semantics unverified.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Postfix increment and decrement operators have a near-universal canonical definition.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): This reduces boilerplate code while still expressing the universally-known meaning of the function.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Every parent class which inherits from incrementable must explicitly make the postfix operator visible with a using expression, as the prefix operator in my_class shadows the postfix in incrementable.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 39 passes): The issue with a rewrite rule is that increment and decrement operators are not as suitable for implicit operations as equality and comparison ones.

candidate 2 (found by 1 of 39 passes): Postfix increment and decrement operators have a near-universal canonical definition.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): It is worth noting that there has been a persistent interest in saving user boilerplate when defining operator overloads with canonical definitions, such as speculated on in [P0436].
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): It was intentionally decided not to add a feature test macro for this proposal, as it would have minimal benefit.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 39 passes): One alternative we considered for this change would be a rewrite rule, similar to the C++20 equality and comparison operator changes, such that `a++` could generate a rewritten candidate equivalent to `[&a]{auto copy{a}; ++a; return copy;}()`.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 39 passes): We do not believe that there is any incompatibility between this paper and P3662.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): Standardising a "default" behaviour for postfix operations would also allow us to shrink the library specification, by expressing operations which are specified to be equivalent to the canonical implementation as being default.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): multiple libraries might all ship their own `incrementable` or `postfix_increment()` variants, which may make slightly different design choices.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 39 passes): The issue with a rewrite rule is that increment and decrement operators are not as suitable for implicit operations as equality and comparison ones.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 39 passes): Ultimately, a rewrite rule is difficult to specify and adds additional traps to the language, so the idea was dropped.
