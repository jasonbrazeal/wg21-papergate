Verdict: Strong to Excellent (12/14)

The paper makes a reasonably strong case for standardizing its proposed facility, with the most persuasive support centered on the structural need for zero-allocation interoperability between senders and awaitables and the fact that a library-only solution cannot remove the allocation or bridge costs. The thinnest parts of the argument concern the breadth of the affected audience and the depth of implementation experience, both of which are asserted more than demonstrated.

- The paper most convincingly establishes why the standard must act by showing that the current de facto ABI works across major compilers but lacks normative guarantee, and that no library-level factory can avoid allocation.
- The prior-art and alternatives discussion is well grounded, acknowledging that frame-erased coroutine handles were the right earlier choice while explaining why senders need frame visibility for zero-allocation operation state.
- The weakest established element is who is affected: the claim about high-throughput networking at millions of operations per second is plausible but not backed with evidence, and the non-consensus EWG poll suggests the affected community’s size or urgency was not fully demonstrated.
- The most glaring omission is implementation experience, where the paper leans on the same compiler-compatibility example and a brief reference to Boost.Cobalt without showing deployed, production-scale use of the proposed standardization.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 48 passes): The only way to obtain a `coroutine_handle<>` today is from a coroutine, and a coroutine requires a frame allocation.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 48 passes): One I/O implementation. Both coroutines and senders consume it. Zero allocation for either path.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 48 passes): Senders need frame visibility. The sender pipeline owns its operation state, knows its size at compile time, and inlines it.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 48 passes): Each addresses a use case the others structurally cannot.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 48 passes): Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary. Each serves the domain where its design choices pay off.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 48 passes): The coroutine executor ([P4003R1](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p4003r1.pdf)[1]) has two operations:
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 48 passes): The awaitable-to-sender bridge in [P4093R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p4093r0.pdf)[5] demonstrates this: the bridge creates a coroutine whose sole purpose is to hold a handle that the reactor can resume.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 48 passes): The committee explored both frame-erased and frame-visible designs. It chose frame-erased. That was the right choice for I/O - type erasure through `coroutine_handle<>` gives type-erased streams, split compilation, and ABI stability.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 48 passes): This paper is additive. It does not take anything away from senders, from coroutines, or from any existing design. It gives senders something they do not have today: zero-allocation access to every IoAwaitable ever written
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 48 passes): The awaitable is the right shape for an I/O operation because it is the shape that makes the language feature free, and this paper makes it free for senders as well.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 48 passes): Multiple coroutine models serving different domains is consistent with the committee's practice.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 48 passes): This means the standard would need to mandate the two-pointer prefix layout - `resume` and `destroy` function pointers at offsets 0 and 1 - so that `from_address` on a user-provided struct produces a valid handle.
