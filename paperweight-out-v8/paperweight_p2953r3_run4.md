Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers solid support in a couple of areas, particularly by showing a concrete implementation and by identifying the specific language rule that permits implausible declarations. However, much of the broader case for standardization is asserted rather than demonstrated, and the thinnest parts concern why this needs a standard change at all rather than some other remedy.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, with a Clang fork used to compile large codebases and a table of observed divergences.
- The paper establishes why the issue matters by pointing to a concrete, unrealistic declaration that the current rules permit.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives only gestures at related work without showing how those options were evaluated.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any argument for why the standard is the right place to fix this, as opposed to guidance, compiler warnings, or library-level approaches.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): This permits implausible declarations like `A& operator=(const A&) && = default`, where the left-hand operand is rvalue-ref-qualified.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): The possibility of these unrealistic declarations makes C++ harder to understand.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): Our concern is that the *unrealistic* declaration `A& operator=(const A&) && = default` is *permitted!*

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 27 passes): These signatures are similarly arcane, we expect that no users make use of them, and these signatures don’t help with template programming either
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 27 passes): Arthur has implemented § 6 Proposed wording (conservative) in his fork of Clang, and used it to compile both LLVM/Clang/libc++ and another large C++17 codebase.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Additional papers in this space (such as [P3834]) must consider adding new, similarly implausible signatures to the language to remain consistent with this oddity.
