Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper offers meaningful support in the areas of motivation, prior art, and implementation experience, but it leaves several essential parts of the standardization case largely unargued. The thinnest support concerns coordination with other proposals and the question of why a library solution cannot achieve the same goals.

- The strongest support comes from the implementation experience, which is concrete, tested across multiple architectures, and directly addresses performance concerns raised in committee.
- The paper also establishes why the change matters by connecting it to type safety, strong typedefs, enumerations, and `std::byte`, and by identifying a real gap in the current `std::simd` constraints.
- The prior art and alternatives section is adequately grounded in the current working draft and related proposals, showing awareness of existing mechanisms and their limits.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established discussion of coordination and interoperability with other standardization efforts or existing library facilities, leaving the proposal’s place in the broader ecosystem unclear.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 48 passes): This minimal change enables type safety, strong typedefs, enumerations, and `std::byte` while maintaining full backward compatibility.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 48 passes): The C++ standard library includes data-parallel types in the `<simd>` header, currently restricting element types to a closed list: arithmetic types and `std::complex` specializations.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 48 passes): This prevents subtle bugs where user-defined operators return incorrect types.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 48 passes): These provide consistency with their scalar counterparts and convenience for common conversions.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 48 passes): We implemented this approach in Intel’s `std::simd` implementation and tested across multiple Intel architectures.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 48 passes): During the last committee meeting, concerns were raised about the performance implications of this approach - what if compilers failed to vectorize the code?

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 48 passes): The working draft currently checks only that element-wise operations are valid expressions, without constraining return types.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 48 passes): The identified limitations motivated the customization design presented in § 7 Design Alternative: Customization Points.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 48 passes): These provide consistency with their scalar counterparts and convenience for common conversions.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 48 passes): [P4006] proposes adding `bit_lshift<>` and `bit_rshift<>` function objects for the shift operators.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 48 passes): By relying on compiler optimization, we can open `simd` to user-defined types without requiring customization points for basic operations.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 48 passes): By changing only the gate-keeping logic for vectorizable types, we enable type safety for strong typedefs, domain-specific types for signal processing and other specialized domains, enumerations, `std::byte`, and small compound types.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 48 passes): Implementation experience with leading compilers (Clang 20, Intel oneAPI 2025.0) has shown that they can.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 48 passes): We implemented this approach in Intel’s `std::simd` implementation and tested across multiple Intel architectures.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 48 passes): Implementation experience demonstrated that element-wise inference produces correct, performant code for most operations.

candidate 4 (found by 2 of 48 passes): To address these concerns we implemented our proposal in Intel’s `std::simd` implementation and tested it across multiple generations of Intel architectures with various user-defined types, enumerations, strong typedefs, and specialized DSP types (saturating arithmetic and fixed-point).
