Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper’s strongest support comes from its record of production use in Folly, which grounds the proposal in real implementation experience and prior art. Beyond that, however, the case for standardization is largely asserted rather than demonstrated, with the thinnest support around who is affected, why a library solution is insufficient, and how the feature would coordinate with existing standard library components.

- The paper clearly establishes implementation experience and prior art through the long-standing production use of `hazptr_obj_cohort` in Folly.
- The paper claims but does not establish that the affected audience is broad enough to justify standardization, relying on general statements about usability rather than concrete evidence.
- The paper claims but does not establish why a library-only solution would be inadequate, leaving the necessity of standardization under-supported.
- The paper offers no discussion of coordination or interoperability with existing standard library facilities, which is the most glaring omission in its standardization case.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This paper proposes supporting object cohorts due to the importance of synchronous reclamation for general purpose usability.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Object cohorts have been part of the Folly open-source library (under the name `hazptr_obj_cohort`) and in heavy use in production since 2018.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): As a result, hazard pointer users must guarantee separately that the deleters of such objects do not depend on resources that may become subsequently unavailable.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Doing so avoids burdening the current thread with potentially performing amortized reclamation of tens of thousands of possibly unrelated retired objects, because calling `retire` may trigger amortized asynchronous reclamation.
