Verdict: Strong (10/14)

The paper offers substantial support for its standardization case in the areas of prior art, coordination, and implementation experience, but its argument is thinnest where it needs to show why a library solution cannot suffice and why the affected community is broad enough to justify standardizing these abstractions.

- The strongest support comes from concrete implementation experience, with two independent libraries delivering the proposed mechanisms on C++20 and multiple Boost projects actively building on the abstractions.
- The paper also establishes meaningful coordination and interoperability benefits, showing that standard buffer concepts and a stable `any_stream` boundary would let otherwise separate I/O stacks share vocabulary.
- The case for who is affected remains mostly asserted rather than demonstrated, resting on a handful of named adopters and one institutional evaluation without broader evidence of need.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established argument for why a library will not do, leaving the central question of standardization necessity unaddressed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 57 passes): Two libraries - Capy and Corosio - use those mechanisms directly to deliver type-erased streams, separate compilation, and ABI stability on C++20 today.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 57 passes): Asio has been used in production worldwide for over twenty years.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 57 passes): each is backed by implementation experience
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 57 passes): Multiple socket implementations can coexist: Corosio's, an io_uring-native one, an IOCP-optimized one, a minimal embedded one.
