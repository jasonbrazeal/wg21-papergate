Verdict: Strong (9/14)

The paper offers meaningful support in several areas, particularly around prior art, implementation experience, and interoperability with existing assertion facilities, but its case is uneven and leaves some central questions about the affected audience and the necessity of standardization only asserted rather than demonstrated.

- The strongest support comes from concrete implementation experience in both libc++ and libstdc++, with available Compiler Explorer links showing the proposal is more than a design sketch.
- The paper also establishes that the approach has been considered against alternatives and that it can coexist with legacy assertion mechanisms without forcing disruptive semantic changes.
- The thinnest part of the case is the absence of any established description of who is affected, which makes the motivating population and its needs largely implicit.
- The argument for why this must be standardized, rather than delivered as a library, rests on a single brief claim about drawbacks of other approaches and is not developed into a persuasive necessity.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): By having a central and user-selectable contract-violation handler, those who assemble large programs can avoid having distinct libraries producing different bug responses that do not fit into a single and consistent diagnostic and mitigation strategy.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Providing the beginnings of a migration path for users of legacy assertion facilities — both `assert` and homegrown solutions — is an essential part of making early use of the Contracts facility viable for many users.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): Integrating these facilities with the contract-violation handler, however, can be an incredibly useful tool for enabling a gradual migration from older facilities to the newer tools provided by the language itself.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): In another, similar proposal, [P3311R0], the name `ASSERT_USES_CONTRACTS` was proposed.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): We chose to have the shared contracts ABI perform enforced contract-termination with `std::abort()` rather than `std::terminate()`.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): Pre- existing contract-checking facilities, such as `assert`, occasionally have fundamentally different semantics and provide completely different control mechanisms for their behavior.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 36 passes): Providing the beginnings of a migration path for users of legacy assertion facilities — both `assert` and homegrown solutions — is an essential part of making early use of the Contracts facility viable for many users.
