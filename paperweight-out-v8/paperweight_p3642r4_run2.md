Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers a solid foundation in some areas, particularly in showing prior art and implementation experience, but it leaves several central arguments asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest support is around the case for standardization itself: the claims about architecture dependence and library inadequacy are repeated but never developed into a concrete argument, and coordination or interoperability concerns are not addressed at all.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, where the paper points to a concrete benchmark comparing a naive implementation with an efficient one from NTL.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives clearly by tying its design to existing proposals like P3161R4 and P3104R3.
- The argument for why a library solution will not suffice is only claimed, resting on a single sentence about architecture dependence and opaque mathematical properties without further explanation.
- The most glaring omission is coordination and interoperability, for which the paper offers no evidence or discussion at all.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Carry-less multiplication is an important operation in a number of use cases:
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Such a widening function is important in a various cryptographic use cases.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The issue with library implementations is that the optimal implementation for `std::clmul` highly depends on the architecture and has interesting mathematical properties that become opaque in the library.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): I also propose a widening operation in the style of [[P3161R4]](https://wg21%2elink/p3161r4)
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): In the example above, `std::clmul(x, x)` is equivalent to [[P3104R3]](https://wg21%2elink/p3104r3)'s `std::bit_expand(x, 0x55555555u)`.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Such a naive implementation is far from optimal though. [[QuickBench]](https://quick-bench%2ecom/q/eG4Q5BR_udnfh4V5f-3d3h3fRHY) shows that a naive `clmul` implementation which computes both the high and the low bits performs 9.2× worse than an efficient implementation taken from [[NTL]](https://github%2ecom/libntl/ntl).
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Most of the design choices take the design of [[P3161R4]](https://wg21%2elink/p3161r4) into consideration:
