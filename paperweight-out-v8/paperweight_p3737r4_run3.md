Verdict: Strong (9/14)

The paper offers solid grounding for why a stricter zero-length `std::array` specification would be useful and shows credible implementation experience, but its case thins considerably when it comes to who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, coordination, and why a library solution cannot suffice. Those latter points are asserted more than demonstrated, leaving the proposal dependent on the reader accepting its framing rather than on evidence presented in the paper.

- The strongest support is the demonstration of real implementation divergence and the concrete benefit of making `std::array<T, N>` trivially copyable when `T` is trivially copyable.
- The paper also establishes relevant prior art by identifying libc++ and libstdc++ as already conforming to the proposed behavior and by framing the MSVC STL situation as an ABI-breaking nonconformance.
- The thinnest support is the claim that affected users and standardizing existing practice justify the change, since the paper does not substantiate who relies on these guarantees or why standardization is necessary.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of a developed argument for why a library-level solution or documented implementation detail would be insufficient, beyond asserting that it would be unusual for WG21 not to standardize widespread practice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): However, its specification in the standard is considerably more permissive and should be simplified.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Notably, there are quite a couple of guarantees that are absent.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The zero-length case is also where we see some implementation divergence in size and alignment of the array.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 27 passes): A stricter specification would provide additional useful guarantees such as `std::array<T, N>` being trivially copyable when `T` is trivially copyable.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The `std::array` class template has established itself as a de-facto replacement for "builtin arrays" or "C-style arrays" in many code bases.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The "greatest common denominator" between these implementations (excluding MSVC STL) should be standardized, which is:
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The MSVC STL implements zero-length `std::array`s incorrectly and does not comply with C++26 (or any prior standard), and fixing this would require an ABI break.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): It seems like the vagueness in the specification serves no practical purpose; it is unclear what implementations could do with the additional freedom, other than pranking their users.
