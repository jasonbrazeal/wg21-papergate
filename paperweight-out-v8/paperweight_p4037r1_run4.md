Verdict: Strong (10/14)

The paper gives a reasonably concrete account of existing practice and real-world use, but it leaves the affirmative case for standardization resting on assertions rather than demonstrated necessity. The thinnest parts are the absence of any argument that a library solution is insufficient and the lack of a developed explanation of how the change coordinates with the broader standard.

- The strongest support comes from implementation experience, with both libstdc++ and libc++ already permitting the relevant types as extensions.
- The paper also establishes who is affected by citing substantial existing code that uses these instantiations despite the current restrictions.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is grounded in existing library behavior and a known issue, though it does not fully weigh the option of leaving the status quo or addressing it outside the standard.
- The most glaring omission is that the paper never establishes why a library cannot provide the needed behavior, leaving the core rationale for standardization incomplete.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The ability to generate random bytes or octets is extremely valuable for fuzz testing.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The current restriction which forbids `unsigned char` is bad, but it's not obvious how much the restriction should be relaxed.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Use of `signed char` or `unsigned char` in `<random>` currently results in undefined behavior.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 27 passes): In 2013, [[LWG2326]](https://cplusplus%2egithub%2eio/LWG/issue2326) `uniform_int_distribution<unsigned char>` should be permitted stated that it's just silly that we have a random number library with no natural way to generate random bytes.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): Generating octets is effectively supported already. `uniform_int_distribution<unsigned int>(0, 255)` is functionally equivalent to `uniform_int_distribution<unsigned char>()`.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): While [[LWG4109]](https://cplusplus%2egithub%2eio/LWG/issue4109) offers the option to make the program ill-formed when the existing restrictions are not satisfied (Option B in the issue), it fails to mention that this would break thousands of files of existing code; see §2. Introduction.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 27 passes): libc++ supports `signed char` and `unsigned char` as an extension. This is the minimum amount of support assuming this paper is accepted
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 27 passes): NB comment [[RU-272]](https://github%2ecom/cplusplus/nbballot/issues/847) is resolved by this paper.
