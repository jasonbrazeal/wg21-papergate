Verdict: Adequate to Strong (8/14)

The paper gives a reasonably clear account of why dynamic structural interfaces recur in practice and shows some implementation experience, but it leaves several parts of the standardization case asserted rather than demonstrated, particularly around who is affected and why a library solution would be insufficient.

- The strongest support comes from the reference implementation and the explicit recognition that existing type-erasure facilities and `proxy` occupy overlapping design space.
- The paper establishes the motivating problem and the intended reflection-based approach, but does not substantiate the claimed breadth of affected users beyond naming existing library facilities.
- The case for standardization over a library is thin, since the claim that the approach is unobtrusive is asserted without evidence about what standardization would add.
- The most glaring omission is the lack of established coordination and interoperability detail, leaving the relationship to existing and proposed type-erasure mechanisms largely as a claim.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Standard librarie facilities such as `std::function`, `std::any`, `std::ranges::any_view` and the many other type-erasure based solutions demonstrate that the need for dynamic structural interfaces is both real and recurring.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): There is currently no function-type in the standard library that can represent an overload set.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): Any type that provides member functions with the same names and function signatures as those specified by the interface is considered to be *conforming* to the protocol.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): This paper explores a different approach to proxy and relies on reflection rather than templates for a smaller API surface.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 36 passes): The absence of a language-supported mechanism for dynamic structural typing explains the proliferation of type-erasure-based abstractions.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 36 passes): Ideally both `protocol` and `protocol_view` would be generated by the compiler using static reflection, eliminating hand-written type-erasure boilerplate or custom build steps.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 36 passes): This paper proposes protocol types as a first-class library feature that fills this gap.
