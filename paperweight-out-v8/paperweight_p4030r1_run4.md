Verdict: Weak to Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers only a thin, largely asserted case for standardization: its motivations are plausible but mostly restated as needs rather than demonstrated, and several key questions are left entirely unaddressed. The strongest material concerns the design rationale for separating endianness handling from UTF transcoding, while the weakest areas are the absence of any implementation experience and the failure to explain why a library solution would not suffice.

- The paper at least articulates a coherent design principle, namely that endianness views should be separate from UTF adaptors to avoid a combinatorial explosion of options.
- The claimed breadth of affected users and use cases, including network protocols and file formats, is asserted but not supported with concrete examples or evidence.
- The paper does not establish why this facility belongs in the standard rather than in a library, leaving a central justification for standardization unaddressed.
- There is no implementation experience presented, so the proposal offers no evidence that the design is workable or that its claimed benefits materialize in practice.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 24 passes): users often need to convert to and from UTF encodings with specific endianness: UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE, UTF-32LE, and UTF-32BE.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 24 passes): it would be harder to read the pipelines if we used names like `from_or_to_little_endian` or `byteswap_if_native_is_big_endian`.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 24 passes): In addition to UTF transcoding, this facility will help users handle endianness conversions for other streams of data, such as network protocols (TCP/IP, TLS, DNS, etc) and file formats (BMP, TIFF).

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 24 passes): Rather than introduce a combinatorial explosion of UTF adaptors with various endianness of input and output, we should follow the single responsibility principle and add standard endianness views so users can handle endianness separately.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 24 passes): The main reason for adding these views is to assist users of the UTF transcoding range adaptors (see [[P2728R11]](https://wg21.link/p2728r11)).
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 24 passes): We include both names for the sake of pipeline readability; it would be harder to read the pipelines if we used names like `from_or_to_little_endian` or `byteswap_if_native_is_big_endian`.
