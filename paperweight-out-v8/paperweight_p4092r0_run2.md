Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers some concrete evidence of implementation and prior art, but it leaves several core parts of the standardization case asserted rather than demonstrated, particularly around who would be affected and why a library solution would not suffice. The strongest support is practical, while the argument for normative action remains thin.

- The paper establishes implementation experience through a complete appendix and reported compilation against community implementations of `std::execution`.
- It establishes prior art and alternatives by situating the bridge relative to coroutine-native I/O, `std::execution`, and the abstraction floor in P4093R0.
- It only claims, without establishing, why the bridge matters and why the standard should contain it, resting on the assertion that coexistence works.
- It does not establish who is affected or why a library would not do, leaving the audience and the need for standardization itself unaddressed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 39 passes): A single class template bridges sender-based code into coroutine-native I/O with inline operation state, correct stop propagation, and automatic dispatch-back.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 39 passes): The bridge is the proof that coexistence works.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 39 passes): The bridge avoids both mechanisms:
