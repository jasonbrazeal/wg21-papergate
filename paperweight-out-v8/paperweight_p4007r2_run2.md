Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers some useful context about prior discussions and Croydon’s resolutions, but it does not build a sustained case for why this work belongs in the C++ standard. The thinnest areas are the absence of any identified affected audience, no argument that a library solution is insufficient, and no implementation experience to ground the proposal.

- The strongest support is the discussion of prior art, including Croydon’s resolutions and the relationship between coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution`.
- The paper claims the topic matters for allocator-sensitive coroutine call trees, but that claim is not developed into a clear standardization need.
- The paper does not establish who is affected, leaving the constituency for the proposal unclear.
- Most glaringly, it offers no implementation experience and no argument for why a library cannot address the problem.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): In a deep coroutine call tree where frame allocation matters - arena-per-request, pool allocators, device memory - every function signature must carry `allocator_arg` explicitly.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 27 passes): `std::execution::task` ([P3552R3](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3552r3.html)[1]) had open issues identified by national ballot comments, LWG issues, and published papers.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Croydon resolved several. This paper classifies each issue by whether it can be resolved after C++26 ships or whether shipping forecloses the fix, and notes which classified issues were addressed at Croydon.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary. Each serves the domain where its design choices pay off.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Of these, Croydon resolved six: Unusual Allocator Customisation, Flexible Allocator Position, and Shadowing The Environment Allocator were addressed by P3980R1[6]
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` are complementary.
