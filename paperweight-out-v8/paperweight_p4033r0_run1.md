Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers some grounding for its proposal in motivation, prior art, and implementation experience, but it leaves the central standardization case largely unargued. The thinnest areas are the absence of any identified audience, the lack of a reason the standard is the right venue, and the missing discussion of coordination or why a library solution would not suffice.

- The strongest support comes from the concrete example showing silent breakage in index-based switch tables and the relative ease of synthesizing scoped enumerators.
- The paper also establishes some prior art by positioning itself against C++26 reflection’s limited `define_aggregate` capability and noting its direct support for annotations and attributes.
- Implementation experience is credited through a linked Godbolt example and an explicit, if modest, statement that the conservative design comes from implementation practice.
- The most glaring omission is that the paper never establishes who is affected, why the standard is needed, how the feature would coordinate with existing facilities, or why a library cannot provide the same capability.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): If variant<Dog, Tanuki, Cat> is later augmented with variant<Dog, Tanuki, Racoon, Cat>, or the variant are shuffled, the index-based switch table will break silently, not the enum based one.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 24 passes): Synthesizing enumerators of a scoped enum is a fairly simple operation, on the other hand rewiring the proper context for enumerators of an unscoped enum is quite more troublesome and error prone...
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 24 passes): Our rationale behind this conservative approach is entirely rooted in our implementation experience (granted not extensive).

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): The generative capability of reflection as they were introduced in C++26 are limited to `define_aggregate`, with no quick paths to more powerful facilities (See [p3294r2] for example).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Our rationale behind this conservative approach is entirely rooted in our implementation experience (granted not extensive).
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Diverging with the original design of `define_aggregate()`, annotations and attributes are directly supported here via `.annotations` and `.attributes`.
