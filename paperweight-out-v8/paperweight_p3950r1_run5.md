Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper offers some relevant framing and a concrete implementation claim, but it does not yet make a complete case for standardization, with the thinnest support around who is affected and how the change would fit with existing practice.

- The strongest support is the prior-art discussion, which shows the restriction has been challenged before and connects the issue to the forthcoming `std::execution` facility.
- The paper asserts that the restriction is arbitrary and that only a compiler change can address it, but these points are stated rather than demonstrated.
- The implementation experience is limited to a single sentence saying the author implemented the approach, without detail about scope, testing, or portability.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any account of who is affected or how the change would coordinate with existing coroutine and execution-library usage.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Disallowing `return_void` alongside `return_value` is fundamentally arbitrary, unnecessarily making `void` a special case.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 30 passes): Unfortunately the standard bans this by fiat (§9.6.4 [dcl.fct.def.coroutine]): *“If searches for the names* `return_void` *and* `return_value` *in the scope of the promise type* *each find any declarations, the program is ill-formed.”*
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 30 passes): Trying to accept `std::execution::set_value_t()` (i.e. successful completion with no values) alongside any other `std::execution::set_value_t(...)` form, on the other hand, does not work.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 30 passes): This restriction has been present in its current form since N4499 ([1] at §6.6.4):

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): There has previously been a paper by a different author with the same goal as this paper [4]. It had no consensus in Cologne in 2019, however the author of this paper feels there is new information [5][6].
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): `std::execution`, which will ship in C++26, provides “the [library] implementation of an `async-function`” ([8] at §6).
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 30 passes): Disallowing it either disadvantages coroutines vis-à-vis `std::execution` or necessitates library workarounds (e.g. the tag type approach discussed in the preceding section).
