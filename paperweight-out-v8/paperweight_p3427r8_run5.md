Verdict: Adequate to Strong (7/14)

The paper gives a reasonably grounded account of why synchronous reclamation matters and shows credible production experience behind the proposed object cohort design, but it leaves several parts of the standardization case asserted rather than argued. The thinnest areas concern how the facility would fit into the standard, interoperate with existing mechanisms, and why the work cannot simply remain a library.

- The strongest support is the implementation experience, with object cohorts in heavy production use in Folly since 2018.
- The paper also establishes the relevance of synchronous reclamation and the drawbacks of the existing asynchronous-only hazard pointer interface.
- It claims, but does not really establish, who is affected beyond pointing to general-purpose usability and the Folly usage.
- The most glaring omissions are any discussion of coordination and interoperability with the standard, and any case for why a library solution would not suffice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This paper proposes supporting object cohorts due to the importance of synchronous reclamation for general purpose usability.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Object cohorts have been part of the Folly open-source library (under the name `hazptr_obj_cohort`) and in heavy use in production since 2018.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): The P2530R3 C++26 hazard pointer interface supports only asynchronous reclamation which does not guarantee the timing of the reclamation of protectable objects that are no longer protected.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 33 passes): In the code snippet on the left side, the removed object is retired by submitting the retirement code to a dedicated thread pool (details not shown) to be executed asynchronously.
