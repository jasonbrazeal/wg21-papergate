Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper gives a partial account of why standardizing `mdspan` copy and fill operations would be useful, but it leaves several important parts of the standardization case asserted rather than demonstrated. The strongest support concerns the existence of a gap relative to `std::linalg::copy`, while the thinnest area is the absence of any implementation experience.

- The paper clearly establishes that existing `std::linalg::copy` is too constrained in rank and that current standard facilities are not sufficient for general `mdspan` copying.
- The discussion of affected application domains and the need for standard rather than user-level support is present but remains more asserted than substantiated.
- The paper does not establish any implementation experience for the proposed operations.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): However, without standard library support, copying efficiently between `mdspan`s with mixes of complex layouts is challenging for users.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 21 passes): This paper is proposing a version of `copy` that is not constrained by the number of ranks and differs from `std::linalg::copy` in some important ways outline below.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): This operation only applies to `mdspan`s with \(rank \le 2\).
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 21 passes): This operation only applies to `mdspan`s with \(rank \le 2\). This paper is proposing a version of `copy` that is not constrained by the number of ranks

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): However, existing standard library facilities are not sufficient here. Currently, `mdspan` does not have iterators or ranges that represent the span of the `mdspan`.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 21 passes): We settled on `<mdspan>` because as proposed this is a relatively light-weight addition that reflects operations that are commonly desired with `mdspan`s.
