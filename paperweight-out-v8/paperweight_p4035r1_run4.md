Verdict: Adequate (7/14)

The paper offers genuine support in the places where it can point to concrete implementation experience and a clear design rationale, but much of its broader case rests on assertions that are not backed up with evidence in the text. The thinnest area is the failure to explain why a library solution would not suffice, which leaves a central question about the need for standardization unanswered.

- The strongest support comes from the Boost.URL implementation experience, which demonstrates that the validating default and unsafe escape hatch pattern has already shipped and been used in practice.
- The paper clearly articulates why the type matters by situating it between `std::string` and `std::string_view` and by appealing to the principle that safe defaults should be easy.
- The claim that over 2,100 GitHub implementations show demand is asserted but not substantiated with any detail or analysis.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any argument for why a library cannot provide this functionality, which is essential to justifying standardization.

## motivation - grade 1.50 (fired in 3 of 6 sections, strong in 1)  (ON THRESHOLD)

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): C++ should make the safe thing easy, and the unsafe thing possible.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 18 passes): The type fills a real gap: `std::string` owns and null-terminates, `std::string_view` does not own and does not null-terminate, and `cstring_view` does not own but does null-terminate.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 18 passes): The evidence documents a recurring design value: safe by default, with explicit escape hatches where zero-cost composition requires them.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 18 passes): Over 2,100 independent implementations on GitHub confirm the demand.

## prior_art - grade 1.17 (fired in 2 of 6 sections, strong in 1)  (ON THRESHOLD)  (SHARED PASSAGE)

  [6] References                                   0/0/0  -> 0.00
candidate 1 (found by 2 of 18 passes): Boost.URL has shipped this pattern with years of field experience: a validating default (`pct_string_view` [5]) and an escape hatch (`make_pct_string_view_unsafe` [5]) for trusted boundaries.
candidate 2 (found by 1 of 18 passes): The naming convention appears in the standard library, and the full pattern - naming and contract - appears in production Boost libraries, in the current `cstring_view` proposal, and in coroutine-based concurrency libraries.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 18 passes): The standard library already provides constrained defaults with explicit broader counterparts.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 18 passes): C++ earns its reputation as a zero-cost abstraction language by letting programmers pay only for what they use.
