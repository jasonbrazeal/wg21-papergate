Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper offers a narrow but genuine basis for its standardization case: it establishes that the current behavior is inconsistent and that an implementation exists, but it leaves the affected audience, the necessity of a standard solution, and the interoperability picture largely unaddressed. The thinnest part of the argument is the absence of any demonstrated reason why a library-level or non-standard remedy cannot suffice, which is central for a proposal of this kind.

- The strongest support is the concrete demonstration of implementation experience, with the feature shipping in a real library and tested on current toolchains.
- The paper also establishes the motivating inconsistency clearly, showing that call and subscript operators are treated differently from other operators without apparent justification.
- The discussion of prior art and alternatives is credited, particularly the comparison with related wrapper proposals and the observation that `constant_wrapper` sits awkwardly in `<type_traits>`.
- The most glaring omission is the failure to establish who is affected or why a library solution will not do, leaving the practical need for standardization unproven.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 27 passes): because of language inconsistencies, std::constant_wrapper is inconsistently not unwrapping for call and subscript operators whereas all other operators can be found via ADL and the conversion operator implemented in constant_wrapper.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): The most glaring question on this issue is why would we do this for `operator()` and `operator[]` but for none of the other operators. This seems inconsistent.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): We should reconsider the placement of `constant_wrapper` in `<type_traits>`.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): As discussed in [P3948R0], because of language inconsistencies, std::constant_wrapper is inconsistently not unwrapping for call and subscript operators whereas all other operators can be found via ADL and the conversion operator implemented in constant_wrapper.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): `constant_wrapper` is not a trait. `integral_constant` is not a trait either, but it is the type of many traits. `constant_wrapper` is a utility (`<utility>`).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): With this paper, `constant_wrapper` almost achieves parity with what was proposed for `fn_t` / `function_wrapper` by Schultke et al. [P3774R0] and Müller [P3843R2].
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): Relative to [P3978R1], this paper’s wording has the following change:
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): As discussed in [P3948R0], because of language inconsistencies, std::constant_wrapper is inconsistently not unwrapping for call and subscript operators whereas all other operators can be found via ADL and the conversion operator implemented in constant_wrapper.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The only possibility that is not a breaking change is to add syntax that opts into new behavior, which has a high acceptance barrier.
