Verdict: Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers only a narrow foundation for its standardization case: it establishes that efficient copying between differently laid-out `mdspan`s is a real problem, but leaves nearly every other necessary justification asserted rather than demonstrated. The thinnest areas are the absence of any evidence about who is affected or any implementation experience, and the repeated unsupported claims that existing facilities and non-standard libraries cannot suffice.

- The strongest support is the established point that users face genuine difficulty copying efficiently between `mdspan`s with complex, mixed layouts.
- The paper claims, but does not show, that existing standard facilities are insufficient and that a library solution would not address the need.
- The paper claims relevance to HPC, graphics, and other domains but never establishes who is actually affected or how broadly.
- The most glaring omission is the complete lack of implementation experience or any concrete evidence that the proposed facility has been tried and found workable.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 21 passes): However, without standard library support, copying efficiently between `mdspan`s with mixes of complex layouts is challenging for users.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 21 passes): This paper is proposing a version of `copy` that is not constrained by the number of ranks and differs from `std::linalg::copy` in some important ways outline below.

candidate 1 (found by 2 of 21 passes): However, existing standard library facilities are not sufficient here. Currently, `mdspan` does not have iterators or ranges that represent the span of the `mdspan`.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 21 passes): We settled on `<mdspan>` because as proposed this is a relatively light-weight addition that reflects operations that are commonly desired with `mdspan`s.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 21 passes): However, existing standard library facilities are not sufficient here.

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 21 passes): Many applications, including high-performance computing (HPC), image processing, computer graphics, etc that benefit from `mdspan` also would benefit from basic memory operations provided in standard algorithms such as copy and fill.
