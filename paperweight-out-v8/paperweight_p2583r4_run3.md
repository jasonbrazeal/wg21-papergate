Verdict: Strong (8/14)

The paper offers a solid technical motivation and useful evidence from prior art and implementation experience, but it does not yet make a complete case for standardization. The thinnest parts are the arguments that this must be done in the standard rather than in a library, and the lack of established evidence about who is affected or how the change would coordinate with existing practice.

- The strongest support is the clear explanation of why the current sender protocol prevents symmetric transfer from limiting stack growth.
- The paper also establishes meaningful prior art by identifying a protocol-level fix and situating it against the authors’ related work.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of an established case for why the standard, rather than a library, is the necessary venue for this change.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): When a coroutine co_awaits a sender that completes synchronously, the stack grows by one frame per completion.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): Under the current protocol, the sender model's architectural choice - composing operations through non-coroutine sender algorithms with void-returning completions - prevents this mechanism from operating.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 24 passes): A protocol-level fix exists: completion functions and `start()` return `coroutine_handle<>` instead of `void`, enabling struct receivers to propagate handles from downstream without becoming coroutines.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 24 passes): An alternative approach is possible: make the return type a compile-time property of the receiver.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 24 passes): The limitation documented here exists independently of any alternative design.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 24 passes): The authors developed [P4003R3](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P4003R3.pdf) [4] ("A Minimal Coroutine Execution Model") and [P4007R3](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P4007R3.pdf) [5] ("Open Issues in `std::execution::task`").
