Verdict: Adequate (7/14)

The paper gives a reasonably clear account of the core-language problem and why existing rules fail, but its case for standardization is uneven: the motivation and prior art are well supported, while the affected audience, library-only alternatives, and implementation experience are largely asserted rather than demonstrated.

- The strongest support is the explanation of why the current deduction rules produce ill-formed or unimplementable cases, including the note that there is no known library wording fix without core language changes.
- The discussion of prior art is also solid, tying the proposal to CWG 3003, LWG 4381, and earlier matching changes such as P0552R0.
- The paper claims implementation experience and real library use, but does not establish who is affected or provide evidence beyond broad statements that current implementations accept the examples.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established case for why a library-only solution will not do, despite that being central to justifying a core language change.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): This means that default template arguments specified on the template template parameters are ignored during deduction and that types can be deduced that can’t otherwise be written using the name of the template template parameter.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Both cases would currently be ill-formed due to the current rules for CTAD for alias templates, i.e., they would both fail the deducible check
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 33 passes): There is no known fix for the library wording without changes to the core language, see LWG 4381.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 33 passes): This currently crashes most implementations, but as the *defining-type-id* of Alias doesn’t denote a deducible template, it should just be ill-formed.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 33 passes): addressing both CWG 3003 and LWG 4381.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 33 passes): But since [P0552R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0522r0.html) "DR: Matching of template template-arguments excludes compatible templates", a template template argument doesn’t have to match a template template parameter exactly; the template template parameter just needs to be more specialized than the template template argument.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 33 passes): Current implementations accept the above examples (except for the last one) with the "simple substitution" semantics.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 33 passes): But this looks like something that should be addressed by a future revision of P3579R0 "Fix matching of non-type template parameters when matching template template parameters"
