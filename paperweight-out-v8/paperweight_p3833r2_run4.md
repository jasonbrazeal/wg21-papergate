Verdict: Adequate (6/14)

The paper gives a reasonably concrete account of the gap it targets and points to an available implementation, but it leaves several parts of the standardization case more asserted than demonstrated. The thinnest support concerns who would actually use the facility, how it fits with existing practice and future work, and why a library solution would be insufficient.

- The strongest support is the stated motivation: the paper clearly contrasts `std::multi_lock` with `std::scoped_lock` and identifies missing deferred, timed, and transferable multi-mutex ownership.
- The paper also establishes some prior art and implementation experience by citing related work and linking to a complete implementation.
- The weakest part is the absence of any established audience or affected-user discussion, leaving the practical demand for standardization unclear.
- The paper likewise does not establish coordination with related proposals or make a convincing case that a non-standard library could not provide the same functionality.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 36 passes): Unlike `std::scoped_lock`, which provides only basic RAII semantics, `std::multi_lock` offers the full flexibility of `std::unique_lock` (deferred locking, try-lock operations, timed locking, and ownership transfer) while supporting multiple mutexes simultaneously.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 36 passes): The variadic template approach maintains type safety, allows heterogeneous mutex types, and enables compile-time optimizations that would not be possible with a runtime container.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 36 passes): This gap forces developers to choose between: 1. Using `std::scoped_lock` and restructuring code to avoid deferred/timed locking scenarios 2. Managing multiple `std::unique_lock` objects manually, which is verbose and error-prone
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 36 passes): Uses deadlock-free acquisition of multiple mutexes

candidate 1 (found by 1 of 36 passes): Additionally, it is probably preferable to keep the interface similar to that of `unique_lock` and `scoped_lock` to complete the family of mutex wrapper classes with a consistent design.
