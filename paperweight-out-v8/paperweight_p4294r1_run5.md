Verdict: Adequate (5/14)

The paper offers solid support in the areas most central to the design rationale: it connects the proposed adaptors to an obvious gap in the existing range adaptor set, shows clear prior art in `take`/`drop` and other libraries, and provides implementation experience. The case is much thinner, however, on the institutional questions—who specifically needs this, why it cannot live in a library, and how it coordinates with existing or planned standard facilities.

- The strongest support is the alignment with existing `views::take` and `views::drop`, which makes the missing suffix counterpart feel like a natural standardization target.
- The paper also establishes prior art and implementation experience, showing the design is grounded in existing practice rather than speculation.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any argument for why this cannot be provided by a third-party library, which leaves the standardization need largely assumed.
- Equally unaddressed are the affected users and coordination with the broader standard, so the paper never says who is blocked today or how this fits into the committee’s existing range work.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): fill an obvious gap in the standard range adaptor set
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): There is currently no direct adaptor that operates on the *suffix* of a range.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 30 passes): An input-only, non-sized range provides neither, and cannot support the operation without buffering — we explicitly do not want that.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 30 passes): The non-sized cases are what we're truly interested in; and the views class would require:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 30 passes): They mirror the shape of the existing `views::take` / `views::drop` adaptors and fill an obvious gap in the standard range adaptor set.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 30 passes): C++20 introduced `views::take` and `views::drop` to select or discard a *prefix* of a range.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 30 passes): | Library / Language | take last n elements | drop last n elements |
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 30 passes): Following `take_view` / `drop_view`, both constructors add:
