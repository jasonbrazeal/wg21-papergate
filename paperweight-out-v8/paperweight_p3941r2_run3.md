Verdict: Weak to Adequate (4/14)

The paper offers some support for its standardization by explaining why the change matters and by situating it against prior discussion and alternatives, but it leaves several essential parts of the case unaddressed. The thinnest areas concern who is affected, why the standard is the right venue, and how the feature would coordinate with existing practice.

- The strongest support is the explanation that removing `affine_on` responds to concerns raised in prior discussion and points toward a better design.
- The paper also establishes prior art and alternatives by referencing earlier proposals and the original `continues_on` approach.
- The most glaring omission is the absence of any established case for why this belongs in the standard rather than in a library or existing implementation.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): There were multiple concerns raised against the specification of `affine_on` and discussed as part of [P3796R1](https://wg21.link/P3796R1).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): It isn’t adding any new functionality but removes a problematic way to achieve something which can be better achieved differently.
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 15 passes): The discussion on `affine_on` revealed some aspects which were not quite clear previously and taking these into account points towards a better design than was previously specified:

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 15 passes): There were multiple concerns raised against the specification of `affine_on` and discussed as part of [P3796R1](https://wg21.link/P3796R1).
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 15 passes): The original proposal for `task` used `continues_on` to schedule the work back on the original scheduler.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 15 passes): [P3718R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3718r0.html) is, however, discontinued (for unrelated reasons) and adding the guarantee to get the current scheduler from a receiver query is proposed here.
