Verdict: Weak (3/14)

The paper offers only a narrow foundation for its standardization case: it clearly explains why the existing name has become misleading, but it leaves nearly every other necessary justification unaddressed. The thinnest areas are the absence of any identified affected users, any argument for why the standard is the right vehicle, and any evidence of implementation experience or coordination.

- The strongest support is the established point that `std::runtime_format` is now evaluable at compile time, so the name conflates evaluation time with how the format string is supplied and validated.
- The paper gestures at prior art and alternatives by citing P2918 and P3391, but it does not actually establish that the proposed change aligns with existing practice or that alternatives were meaningfully considered.
- The paper does not establish who is affected by the current name or why the standard, rather than a library or documentation change, is required.
- The most glaring omission is the complete lack of implementation experience, coordination, or interoperability discussion for a change that would touch existing standardized terminology.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): As a result, `std::runtime_format` can now be evaluated at compile time, making its name misleading.
candidate 2 (found by 2 of 27 passes): The real distinction is not when formatting occurs, but how the format string is provided and validated.
candidate 3 (found by 1 of 27 passes): The real distinction is not when formatting occurs, but how the format string is provided and validated. The term runtime conflates it with evaluation time.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 27 passes): The name `std::runtime_format` was accurate when introduced in [P2918], as format strings were not usable in constant evaluation.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 27 passes): This aligns with existing terminology `std::format` such as dynamic format specifiers (`check_dynamic_spec`).
candidate 3 (found by 2 of 27 passes): [P2918] introduced `std::runtime_format` to allow opting out of compile-time format string checks in `std::format`. Subsequently, [P3391] made `std::format` usable in constant evaluation.
candidate 4 (found by 1 of 27 passes): [P2918] introduced `std::runtime_format` to allow opting out of compile-time format string checks in `std::format`.
