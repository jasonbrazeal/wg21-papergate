Verdict: Strong (9/14)

The paper offers solid support for the existence of a real problem and for the need to solve it at the language or standard-library level rather than through portable user code, but its case thins considerably when it comes to demonstrating that the proposed facility has actually been built, used, or coordinated with existing practice. The strongest material concerns motivation and the inadequacy of current alternatives; the weakest concerns evidence of implementation experience and interoperability.

- The paper clearly establishes that current C++ makes efficient multi-word and overflow-aware operations cumbersome, error-prone, and effectively impossible to deliver portably without compiler-specific support.
- It also establishes that existing standard facilities and accepted proposals cover only narrow cases such as saturation, leaving a genuine gap for the operations proposed here.
- The paper claims but does not establish that a third-party library cannot provide the same optimization opportunities, since the supporting argument relies on general statements about compiler access rather than demonstrated barriers.
- The most glaring omission is implementation experience: a reference implementation is mentioned and linked, but the paper does not show that it has been used, tested, or validated in practice.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 54 passes): It's rather cumbersome and error prone to implement similar functionality using only C++, resulting in extremely inefficient code for what could often be a couple or even a single line of assembly.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 54 passes): I lament the fact that C++ doesn't have a better syntax and support features for multiple return values.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 54 passes): A developer trying to deliver these features as a portable third-party library would be faced with the monumental task of having to tailor code specifically for every permutation of compiler and CPU that the library aimed to support.
candidate 4 (found by 2 of 54 passes): The most relevant consideration at the moment is that the naming scheme remains consistent to that which has been previously adopted by the C++ standard.

candidate 1 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The paper [P0543], has already been accepted and is on track for C++26, however "saturation" is just a narrow type of overflow behavior, which is insufficient to implement things like multi-word integers.
candidate 2 (found by 3 of 54 passes): Functions such as the trivial division (/), std::div, and std::saturating_div already expects the user to check and avoid calling the function if it would trigger undefined behavior.
candidate 3 (found by 3 of 54 passes): [P4052R0] having thus taken inspiration from Rust, carrying_add, borrowing_sub, and widening_mul were selected.
candidate 4 (found by 3 of 54 passes): The [analysis paper] and [P3018R0] suggests the addition of "overflowing_add", "overflowing_sub", "overflowing_mul", and "overflowing_div", and yet they are not part of this paper.

candidate 3 (found by 1 of 54 passes): The reference also illustrates the difficulty of implementing these features effectively using only standard C++, and in order to be efficient it relies heavily on compiler specific features and even inline assembly with instructions specific to a particular CPU.
